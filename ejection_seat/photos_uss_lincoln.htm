    pier-side at Norfolk Naval Station. Principal speaker for the event was
    Secretary of Defense, Richard Cheney, currently US Vice-President.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>General Quarter Drill</b>.
    Firefighting skills are emphasized for the entire crew of USS Abraham
    Lincoln, but nowhere is it more important than to the flight deck crews,
    shown here during a general quarter drill in 1990. Flight deck crews
    simulate aircraft which are on fire due to various scenarios. During the
    Vietnam war, the USS Forrestal suffered a major fire on the flight deck, due
    to an accidental discharge of a rocket, killing well over 100 crew members.
    The rocket which launched from an F4 jet across the flight deck, causing a
    chain reaction, making all the aircraft explode along with their ordinance.
    Since then, safety and firefighting techniques have been implemented to keep
    that kind of disaster from happening again.</font></p>

    lands, he is evaluated by the squadron commander. For high marks, the ideal
    wire to catch is the number three wire.</font></p>
