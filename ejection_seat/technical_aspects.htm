    <a href="http://www.martin-baker.com/"> Martin-Baker Aircraft Corporation</a> in Higher Denham, England. The MarkGRU-7 used in the A-6E/KA-6D Intruder was retained in the aircraft by the "Top Latch Mechanism."  The mechanism consists of a spring-loaded plunger, which extends from the seat between the two main structural beams of the seat.  The plunger, when locked extends thru a window in a tab at the top of the ejection gun.  The ejection gun is mounted to the cockpit structure.  As a result of the design, the top latch plunger is the sole item that retains the seat in the aircraft.  Normally locked by spring pressure, the firing of the ejection gun presses the plunger from the window, allowing the seat to depart the aircraft

    In the case of LT Gallagher's seat, the window had cracked, presumably due to the repetitive stress of the combined aircrew/seat weight striking against it during negative 'G' maneuvers over the years.  The "porpoising" maneuver in his particular mishap was the "straw that broke the camel's back."  The top section of the window sheared away - the two breaks running from the upper corners of the window to the top corners.<br>
    <br>
    On the back of the GRU-7 series seat, there are two trip rods that actuate the two timer mechanisms that sequence a normal ejection, both triggered as the seat begins to move up the rails of the ejection gun.  One trip rod controls the deployment of the drogue parachute and the firing of the under-seat rocket motor, while the other controls the crewman's harness release and main parachute deployment.  (This same mechanism is linked to automatic locks on the ejection control handles -- designed for the aircrew's safety in the event a ground escape is required -- explaining why LT Gallagher could not pull his lower ejection handle.) So with both trip rods pulled, LT Gallagher's seat performed as if he had ejected and released him from the seat and deployed his main parachute.  Had the seat slid about 18 inches higher, the main rocket motor, initiated by a cable attached between the seat and the ejection gun, would have fired also

    <br>
    I was the Quality Assurance Representative for Aircrew Survival Systems in VA-95 at that time, so I was well involved in the investigation of this incident.<br>
    <br>
    That day, AME2 Mike McQueen came into the berthing and woke me up (I worked nights at the time), saying, "We just had a partial ejection."</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Half awake, I replied, "Mac, there's only successful and unsuccessful ejections."
    All he did was stare at me and flatly state, "Come on, you're gonna have to see this to believe it"</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Post-mishap inspection revealed a two key points - the one that stuck out most to me was that the gun was manufactured in 1963.  It had been in service (and subjected to the negative-G stresses) for 28 years.  So the question in my mind was "How many other seats are approaching the point of a similar failure?"  The U.S. Navy had the same question, so every A-6E, KA-6D, EA-6B, and F-14A with similarly aged ejection guns were directed to be removed and X-rayed for similar defects.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The results in our squadron alone were a little disturbing.  We uncovered several other ejection guns with questionable top latch windows.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since that day, every GRU-7 style ejection seat that goes thru a scheduled inspection (every 224 days for the A-6E/EA-6B), must have it's ejection guns inspected by either eddy current or dye penetrant (eddy current being the preferred method), and any visual defects are grounds for immediate replacement.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I personally have seen a number of guns fail this inspection over the last 9 years, but I never revisited an incident such as what LT Gallagher endured.  So his harrowing experience has most likely saved another aviator from a similar (or worse) fate.</font></p>

    At the time of this report (January 2001) Paul Jung was a Navy Safety and Survival Systems Technician attached to VAQ-134 (The "Garudas") at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, WA.&nbsp;

    in 1991 at the time of Keith Gallagher's

    <b><font face="Arial" size="3">Kevin Coyne's Summary of Events:</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Based on the report above
    and LT Gallagher's account, I believe this is what occurred.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">1. The Martin-Baker seat is
    held in the aircraft by a top latch mechanism, which is essentially a
    plunger forced into a 'V' shaped groove on the top of the catapult. It is
    inserted through a hole in a metal shield known as the 'Ejection Gun
    Cylinder Barrel Safety Latch'. This hole is known as the 'Top Latch Window'.
    Due to metal fatigue, the upper portion of the Top Latch Window broke off
    when exposed to the .5 negative G force from the pilot's pushover. The
    combined weight of the seat and man is nearly five hundred pounds, so this
    force was equivalent to about 250lbs against the top latch window.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">2. When the top latch
    window broke, the seat rose far enough up under the negative Gs to pull the
    trip rod sears from both the drogue gun, and timer release mechanism.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">3. Approximately&nbsp; 3/4
    of a second later, after the drogue gun timer ran out, (recall LT.&nbsp;
    Gallagher's account that for a brief moment he felt his head touch the
    canopy followed by a loud bang)&nbsp; the drogue gun fired its slug through
    the plexiglass of the canopy, pulling out the drogue chute. This began the
    seat movement up the rails by air drag and put the BN's upper body into the
    air stream.&nbsp; The seat does not travel high enough to pull the cable that
    initiates the firing of the main rocket motor.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">4.&nbsp; A second or so
    later, the TRM (time release mechanism) released the scissor shackle and the
    rest of the restraints on the seat as if seat separation was occurring. This
    allowed the drogue to extract the main parachute from its container and
    stream it out into the airflow. This in turn pulled the seat up to the
    position where it stuck due to the wind forces bending the catapult back
    slightly, and the harness from the chute holding Lt Gallagher in place as
    the chute wrapped around the tail of the aircraft.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">5. Despite severe wind
    buffeting, the BN's attempts to pull the lower ejection handle, and
    the&nbsp; deceleration of the trap, the BN and ejection seat remain held in
    about the same
    position (tethered to the tail of the aircraft by his parachute and chute
    shoulder harness)
    until the pilot lands the aircraft on the deck of the Lincoln and the crash
crew
    secure the ejection seat and lift the BN from the seat.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Alan Cody (aeronautical
    engineer/escape systems)<br>
    Phoenix, AZ USA - Tuesday, September 23, 2003 at 03:59:29 (EDT)</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would be interesting to
    hear Martin-Baker's side of this story. While prolonged and repeated
    negative g forces could theoretically induce metal fatigue within the
    ejection catapult latching assembly as described, I am skeptical that
    negative g's were the the contributing factor. The negative g forces
    required to cause structural failure of the catapult's top latch
    "window" would far exceed the dynamic force required to
    reposition/retract the top latch mechanism's locking plunger and
    "unlock" the seat from the catapult as the catapult's inner barrel
    initially extends/telescopes upward during ejection; thus, the seat should
    unlock far before structural failure.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since the Air Force never
    encountered this type of problem with its Phantoms which also flew high g
    profile missions and were equipped with similar Mk-7 seats, I'd suggest the
    Navy-wide problem could instead be a result of prolonged cycles of repeated
    high positive g's during carrier landings which would just as easily
    overstress the top latch assembly due to the majority of the seat and
    occupant's weight being located forward of the seat's vertical axis. During
    a carrier landing and hook arrestment, this weight is forced far forward of
    the seat's center of gravity which will force the top latch mechanism's
    locking plunger (which is bearing the entire weight of seat and crewmember)
    to move forward and upward within the catapult's top latch
    "window", thus creating identical stresses to those encountered
    during negative g's. Different cause-same effect.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">If the catapult was in fact
    prone to structural failure as described, it would've easily been evident
    during crash recovery of intact cockpits within which the catapult's subject
    outer barrel remained after ejection. The 12-18 positive g's placed upon the
    seat structure during the seat's initial vertical movement would surely have
    similarly damaged the catapult had metal fatigue been present. Definitely an
    interesting study! Glad Keith survived and that's what is most important!<br>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Alan Cody hit the nail on
    the head! In addition to the stresses of carrier landings, I'd also consider
    the 3 to 4 positive G's created during carrier catapult launches. It may not
    sound like much at first but it is a helluva lot of stress to place upon the
    top latch mechanism's locking plunger window which is only about one inch
    square and the stress would be compounded over time by the cycles of
    repeated launches/landings.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">As indicated by Mr. Cody,
    the Air Force did not encounter this problem with their Martin-Baker
    equipped Phantoms and that's simply because they did not perform high G
    carrier landings &amp; launches. The argument of in-flight negative G forces
    holds little merit because the Air Force Phantoms (especially the G-model
    Wild Weasels) frequently performed extreme high G maneuvers as they
    ingressed and egressed their target areas.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Additionally, both the Navy
    Blue Angels and Air Force Thunderbirds flew Phantoms for several years
    during which they too performed repeated extreme high G aerobatic maneuvers
    without any damage to seat catapults. I must note that the catapult damage
    could've just as easily been previously caused during maintenance if someone
    had attempted to use a crane to remove the seat from the cockpit without
    first unlocking the seat from the catapult (mistakes do happen).</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Catapults can be inadvertently
    dropped during handling/transport (according to Air Force 11P-series
    technical data, most egress system explosives can be dropped as much as 6
    feet without being condemned for use). There are many potential causes that
    should be closely examined before pointing to the negative G theory as the
    root of the problem.<br>

    - Friday, September 26, 2003 at 09:45:30 (EDT)</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you all for the great
    comments. I enjoy reading them, and I check the log every day.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I want to try to clarify
    some things surrounding the recent engineering discussions, and the force
    required to break the top latch window. I am not an engineer, and it has
    been a while since I thought about this specific aspect of the accident, so
    this will not be infinitely detailed. Martin Baker WAS involved in the
    accident investigation, and I never heard of them disputing any aspect of it
    (perhaps they did, but I never heard about it). There was also an
    engineering investigation into the reason behind the metal failure.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">My memory is this: the
    metal on the top latch window was already cracked, or even broken, on the
    seat before we did the slight negative "G." The seat did not rip
    through a solid piece of very strong metal, it merely completed the crack,
    and broke off a piece that was ready to break. The force required to do this
    was obviously significantly less than the force that would have been
    required to break an intact piece. This set off the chain reaction that is
    outlined on the other page.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why was it cracked? Was it
    cracked from some previous severe force on it, or did it just fatigue over
    time? I do not know if they ever came to a full agreement, but I think the
    prevailing thought was that it happened over time. The seat (and plane) had
    served longer than they had been designed to, and there was even a theory
    that the new catapults on the Nimitz class carriers put a different
    type/level of stress on the seat than had been previously seen. They
    immediately inspected all the seats of that type, and found several with
    cracks. They also added an inspection of the top latch window to the
    semi-annual seat inspection. If my memory is correct, I believe that they
    found over 15 seats with cracks over the next two years.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I hope that helps to
    clarify some of the questions. Thank you again for your comments,
    discussion, and questions.<br>

    Quite simple really - when the ejection gun (catapult) fires, the inner tube moves upward and the ramped area at the top pushes the top latch plunger from the window.  This releases the main beam assembly - the backbone of the actual seat assembly - from the aircraft structure.</font></p>
