    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>A FEW OF THE FAVORABLE COMMENTS:</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Gordon Kurtz: I just finished reading
    your story. Words fail me at this time because I found it to be a powerful
    and moving story of a young man who comes to maturity during the time of our
    nation's greatest challenge. You found a way to weave humor, suspense,
    compassion, and most of all honesty into your tale. You are everyman; you
    are your own man.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Chris Brown: I just got finished reading
    the chapters of your WWII adventures. It was a great pleasure to learn
    something about an era that is just so much history to a man in his 30s. I
    feel a little bit like I was there with you after reading your story.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Walt Warren: I have been sitting here
    reading your story for the last 3 hours. I can't say how much enjoyment I
    have gotten from it. …. I have read many books in the last 55 years and I
    have enjoyed yours as much as any written by a "professional"
    author.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Bill Granage: I just finished reading
    your story of your "War Years." I found it and enjoyed it so much
    that I could not leave my computer until I finished reading it. Thanks for
    the trip back in history. … Again, thanks for all the effort that went
    into your excellent picture of life during a different time and different
    war.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Josh Auerbach: I stumbled on your son's
    web site and was drawn into your WWII memoir. I just wanted to write to tell
    you how very much I enjoyed it. It is the first thing I've read about the
    Second World War that presented the real-life details - the food, the
    housing, etc. - rather than the political or military history, and it was
    fascinating for just that reason. Thanks for sharing your memories.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Keith from Australia: Over the last
    couple of nights, I have read with great interest your story of army service
    and life after the war. Well done. It was very good reading.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Curg Click: I just wanted to say how
    much I enjoyed reading your story about your experiences during the war.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Bill McClellan: Mr. Gallagher: I read
    every page of your book and enjoyed every word, sentence, paragraph,
    chapter, and the pictures too. Your book is one of the very best on WW II I
    have read, and at age 60, I know I have read hundreds of them during my
    life. Thank you for making it possible for my family and me to live in
    freedom. With great respect, Bill McClellan, Herndon, VA 20170, March 1,
    2009</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Floris: Message: Hi Bob, Thanks for
    sharing your interesting experiences. It's good to read a WW2 story from the
    perspective of an 'average' G.I. from that time. Regards, Amsterdam,
    Netherlands, Floris de Vroe</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From: Kenneth J. Maccaux, This is one of the
    best memoirs I have ever read on WWII. Thank you for sharing your personal
    experiences and giving me insight as to what it was really like to fight a
    war. Ken</font></p>
