    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The train took us south through Scotland and
    the western part of England. The sky and landscape were all one color; a
    drab gray that varied only in its shades. The weather was cold and the mood
    of the troops glum. Nothing that had happened, nothing we had seen, nothing
    we had eaten since we left New York City did anything to improve our morale.
    We knew we were getting closer to where the war was raging and the chances
    were good we would soon be participants in it. However, it was not the fear
    of combat that created the glum mood. We had expected that, and to some
    degree looked forward to it through the eyes of those who are misinformed
    about the horrors of war. Our environment was setting our tone. It was our
    lousy living conditions that bothered us. It would get a lot worse, and
    soon.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived in the town of Wellington,
    unloaded, and traveled a short distance by truck to Camp Stapley in the
    southwest corner of England.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>It was in Pitminster Parish, about six
      miles west of the town of Taunton.&nbsp; Immediately east of camp was a
      Royal Air Force (RAF) airbase named Churchstanton that was used to launch
      Spitfire and Hurricane fighter planes earlier in the war.&nbsp; It was now
      mainly a glider base.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>A few miles southwest was another
      airfield called Upottery.&nbsp; It was an RAF airfield used extensively by
      the United States Air Force.&nbsp; On D-day, paratroopers from the 82nd
      and 101st Airborne Divisions were flown from there to Normandy beachheads
      in C-47 aircraft.&nbsp; Other C-47s towed Horsa gliders (British) and Waco
      gliders (American) loaded with infantry troops to the invasion site.<sup>1</sup></i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was December 16, 1944, the same day the
    German army started a major counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest area of
    Belgium and Germany. It would later be known as the Battle of the Bulge.<sup>2</sup> We
    got the news about what was happening about a week later, and concluded this
    was a serious reversal to the Allied armies, which had been advancing on all
    fronts up until that time. This was to be the Germans' last great offensive.
    With considerable resources, they drove through parts of Belgium with the
    objective of reaching Antwerp on the Atlantic Coast and splitting the Allied
    armies in two. Early in the offensive, they made extensive advancements. The
    Allied armies were completely surprised and too lightly defended to meet the
    onslaught. Casualties were high among the Americans, and thousands of our
    troops were taken prisoners. We wondered what this all meant to our outfit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On top of the bad news about the setback in the war, we were getting off to a bad start at this new camp. It created
    an immediate dislike for the place that would only get worse as time went
    on. The first thing that happened was we were each given a mattress cover.
    Next, we stood in a long line leading up to a pile of straw. They shoveled
    the straw into the cover with a pitchfork; that was to be our mattress while
    we were in camp. Straw mattresses - how primitive, even for an Army camp!
    Grimes commented, "I thought this stuff was only used to mix with horse
    manure." I had not heard so much griping from my fellow GIs since the
    first time we arrived at Camp Irwin on the Mojave Desert during our
    stateside training.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our fifteen-man crew was then assigned to a
    Nissen hut (Similar to the American-made Quonset hut.) that consisted of a
    concrete slab with a corrugated steel roof formed a semi cylindrical arch
    over the slab (See Fig. 68a). The ends of the building were made of wood with
    a couple small windows and a door at both ends. The windows were covered
    with drapes made of heavy burlap material better described as dirty rags.
    Unlike the Quonset huts, our hut had no windows along the sides. Even with
    the drapes pulled back during the daytime, it was so dark inside we needed
    the lights on at all times. The building was approximately twenty feet wide
    by forty-five feet long and had ample room to accommodate double the men in
    our crew. However, the generous open space would prove to be a detriment
    because the lone stove could not adequately heat so large an area. The
    lights consisted of three naked light bulbs with barely glowing filaments
    that hung from the ends of wires suspended from the ceiling. The building
    had no insulation and there were many cracks in the wooden ends of the
    building. In a desperate effort to keep the cold out, we stuffed rags in
    some of the bigger openings. There was one small, eighteen-inch diameter
    stove-officially named a British coke-and- coal stove-in the middle of the
    hut with a four-inch diameter stack running to the roof. A bed consisted of
    a wooden frame with legs about six inches high. Four-inch wide cloth strips
    were woven inside the frame which left openings about twelve inches square.
    Grimes again commented, "They look like they were made in a high school
    shop course on the first day of class." We put our straw mattresses on
    the bunks and laid our bedrolls on top of them. When we lay on the bed, we
    had to be careful about rolling over. It was easy to poke your elbows
    through the openings in the webbing. The beds were the only furniture in the
    building and substituted for chairs when we were not sleeping. They made
    uncomfortable chairs because they were built too close to the floor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Inside the Nissen hut it was always cold, and
    we stayed there during two months of winter weather. It snowed a lot, and
    with fifteen men going in and out of the hut there were always pools of
    water on the uneven floor from the melted snow being tracked in. This
    required us to put our duffel bags, gas masks, and any clothing we may not
    have been wearing at the time, up on our beds to keep them dry. It greatly
    reduced the amount of room available for sleeping.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Fuel for the stove consisted of a poor grade
    of dried peat with a very low BTU rating. It was a light gray color. During
    the night we arranged to have it stoked every hour. However, when we were
    out of the hut during the day on assignments, there was nobody to tend it.
    No matter how we tried to arrange it, the fire went out often. Starting a
    new one was a difficult task.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we were in the hut, we dressed like we
    were outside, except sometimes, we took off our overcoats. We wore our wool
    OD shirt, pants, a sweater, field jacket, two pairs of socks, a knit hat,
    and boots at all times. Everything except the boots was made of one hundred
    percent wool. At night when we went to bed, the only thing we removed was
    our boots. We each had four wool blankets. Two were our own and the others
    were British-made that had been issued at this camp. The British blankets
    were coarse and stiff. We referred to them as horse blankets. They made our
    skin itch so badly we folded them and used them for padding under our
    bedding. In addition to the blankets, we each had our own bedroll, which
    made a big difference staying warm at night. For most of us, these bedrolls
    were the ones we had bought at the PX in the States. The fellows who were
    stuck with the Army-issued bedrolls offered us a considerable amount of
    money for ours because theirs weren't worth a darn. They were shaped like an
    Egyptian mummy case and fitted close to the body. They were dark green in
    color and made of a nylon material on the outside. The inside was the same
    OD wool material as Army blankets. They allowed for little movement while in
    use, but their greatest drawback was that they furnished little warmth. We
    treasured our PX bedrolls like gold.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The only time the temperature got above fifty
    degrees in the Nissen hut was when the sun came out strong, and that seldom
    happened. The weather was mostly cloudy, cold, and humid the majority of the
    days we were in Camp Stapley.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The only way we could do laundry was to take
    our socks or underwear down to the latrine and wash them in the washbasins.
    We then took the items back to the hut and hung them on ropes we stretched
    across the room. Because of the lack of heat, it took days for items to dry.
    The drying clothing added more moisture to the already damp conditions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our hut happened to be at the edge of the
    camp, and the mess hall and the latrines were over a block away. One good
    feature was we were back to eating American food, which made us all very
    thankful. Sergeant Emerling was doing his thing in the camp kitchen, and he
    was doing it well as usual. Later, we heard he overstayed a trip to London.
    We all held our breath in fear he might lose his job but he held on to his
    stripes and, most important, his job, which made us all sighs in relief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A and B Batteries ate in one building, C and
    D Batteries in another, and Headquarters Battery ate with the officers in a
    third.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We carried our mess kits to the mess hall in
    all kinds of weather, dipped them into a can of boiling water to warm them,
    and then stood in line to get our food. We ate at wooden tables and stayed
    in the mess hall as long as we could for each meal. It was warm there,
    unlike our gun section's hut, but we ate in shifts so there was a limit on
    our stay. The latrine was warm too. We must have been pretty hard up to look
    forward to spending time in the latrine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were issued new shoes called two-buckle
    combat boots. They were high-top shoes that laced up the front and had a
    four-inch-high leather strap attached to the top of them with each boot
    having two buckles to secure the strap around the ankle. We kept the bottoms
    of our pants tucked into the leather strap and then blossomed them out. We
    thought they added something to the look of our uniforms and someone
    compared it to the look of paratroopers' high-laced boots. That was somewhat
    of an exaggeration. Our new boots eliminated the need for the leggings,
    which we had worn as part of our uniform up until that time. We were glad to
    get rid of the leggings (also called puttees) because threading the laces
    took so much time. Putting them on and taking them off was one of those
    nuisance jobs we were glad to eliminate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A British glider base was close by, and
    gliders would fly whenever the weather was clear enough. They were the large
    troop-carrying kind towed by a powered airplane (See Figs. 68b - 68e). We got up close to several
    of them and were amazed at their flimsy construction. They consisted of a
    welded metal tube frame covered with canvas, a plywood floor, and some
    Plexiglas windows front. They did not look as though they would hold up well
    during flight, much less during a rough landing.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There wasn't much to keep us busy in camp,
    and the morale of the battalion as a whole was extremely low for most of the
    time we were there. We had the usual aircraft identification classes, but
    most of us were bored to death of that subject. This was the first time we
    had been at a permanent camp where there was so much idle time. With the
    lack of interesting subjects and too much spare time on our hands, the days
    dragged. We spent many long hours in the cold, damp and dreary Nissen hut
    with only the members of our fifteen-man crew. It was the first time we were
    all billeted in one room. It created a new level of comradeship among us.
    Most of the many idle hours were spent sitting on our bunks staring across
    the puddles on the floor at men whom we had now known for a year and a half.
    Nothing about this camp made us cheerful, so we tried desperately to find
    ways to keep our spirits up. The loneliness made us more tolerant of each
    other. The effect was we began to feel like a family, and it helped us fight
    the depression that crept up on us frequently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was only one inspection of our living
    quarters while we were at this camp. When we first heard about it, we
    wondered how they could expect us to clean up such a miserable place. Dillon
    pushed us to try. We swept the floor, straightened out the bedrolls on the
    bunks, arranged our gear in neat piles on the bunks, and cleaned our rifles.
    After finishing, we looked around and realized the place still looked like a
    grubby dump that could never be classified as neat. We were expecting to
    receive a long list of things to do to improve the appearance of the place.
    At the same time, there did not seem to be any logical way of doing so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Lieutenant Engler and Sergeant Kornich showed
    up for the inspection the next morning. There was the usual call to
    attention as they entered. The two of them walked through the building,
    opened the back door, looked out, turned around and walked back through the
    building and then out the front door.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"What the hell was that?" cried Le
    Claire when they were gone. We never found out what it was but the fact
    there were no more inspections told us someone had decided they were a bad
    idea. We were mighty glad one of our least liked duties was being omitted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For exercise, we went out on the local roads
    and hiked for several hours. The roads were really narrow, winding lanes
    with little traffic. On one of our hikes the weather was very cold and it
    snowed heavily (See Fig. 69a). The squad of ten men I was with got completely
    disoriented in the snowstorm and got lost. The landmarks we had identified
    on the way out were completely covered by snow on the return trip. It was
    even getting hard to determine where the edges of the road were located. The
    temperature had dropped, and we were all getting very cold. After wandering
    around for several more hours, we sent men up to the farmhouses set back
    about a block from the road. Three times in a row, they came back to tell us
    the civilians had no idea where our camp, the British glider base, or even
    the town near our camp was located.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Camp Stapley" src ="images/Snow_Trek_12_69.jpg" width=500 height=384 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Unknown to us at the time, a situation had
    developed in Europe that created fear of giving information. During the
    Battle of the Bulge, German troops who spoke English were masquerading as
    GIs. They were infiltrating Allied lines to cause confusion and chaos. This
    had been going on long enough the civilians in England had been warned they
    should not give out information about the location of military installations
    or even municipalities because of the fear saboteurs might be dressed like
    American soldiers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After several more hours of continuous
    walking in the frigid weather, we wound up in a very small town, where we
    found a pub about the size of a small living room. In fact, it was a room in
    a typical English cottage that looked to be very old. Including the barmaid,
    there were only a half-dozen people in the place, and they seemed startled
    to see us. At first, they were not too friendly, but as we talked to them,
    they became more cordial. The only heat in the room came from an open
    fireplace and the patrons sat on the bare wooden benches near it. They
    seemed dumbfounded soldiers could get lost. One of them whispered to his
    friend, loud enough for us to hear, "Just because they pay those Yankee
    blokes all that money doesn't make them any better soldiers, does it?"
    We had tracked in a lot of snow, and were now leaving puddles all over the
    place. The barmaid, who was probably the owner, never took her eyes off of
    our dripping boots. We were tempted to order a beer-we still referred to it
    as beer at this point even though it was really ale-mainly so that we could
    stay in the warm room longer, but decided against it. While we had not been
    exposed to it at this point, the stories we had heard about British ale
    served at room temperature did not create a craving for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Once they were convinced of our identity, we
    got directions to our camp. We took a lot of pains in getting these
    instructions detailed because we had learned from experience the English
    people had a habit of abbreviating directions. They said things like,
    "Just take the road straight ahead," even though the road had
    several forks that hadn't been mentioned. Or, they would say, "It's
    just down the road a piece," which could mean anything from a hundred
    yards to several miles. They would always conclude their instructions with,
    "You can't miss it."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we left the pub, one of the our men
    commented, "Yeah, you can't miss it if you make the right guesses at
    the intersections they forgot to tell us about." The snow was now quite
    deep and it made walking that much harder. We walked in a straight line and
    took turns being the lead man who opened a trail for the others. As
    anticipated, we did find several forks in the road that had not been covered
    in the instructions but, fortunately, we made the right guesses which
    direction to take.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By the time we got back to camp, we had been
    walking almost ten hours, and we were dead tired and half-frozen. In that
    time, we had only taken one break because there were no dry spots to sit
    down. Several men had frostbite on their hands and toes. Fortunately, I
    didn't. After enduring the extended hike, we entered our Nissen hut looking
    for comfort and relief from the cold. We found only some of what we wanted.
    I removed my steel helmet, gun belt, gas mask, and overcoat. The overcoat
    could have stood up without help at that point. It had gotten wet from the
    snow and later had frozen into a rigid shell. The hut reeked from the musty
    smell of wet wool. I collapsed on my cot in complete exhaustion. I moved the
    cot as close to the stove as possible, looking for more heat, but it was not
    doing the job. Only my hands, within an inch of touching the stove, were
    warming up. The rest of me was far too cool to be comfortable. A nice warm
    shower would have done wonders, but the block-long walk to the latrine and
    back was the last thing I wanted to endure. A trip out the back door and
    down the small hill to our makeshift outdoor john would suffice to relieve
    other bodily functions. I had missed several meals, but not even food was
    high on the want list at the time. I was beginning to shake from the cold.
    When I thought I would not be moving about the hut on the well-puddled
    concrete floor any longer that evening, I removed my wet boots, changed to a
    couple of pairs of dry socks, and put on a dry woolen cap. Still dressed in
    all my clothes including the field jacket, I opened my sleeping bag, put the
    two army blankets inside, and slid down into it. Working myself into a fetal
    position, I moved down to the point where I could no longer see light. I
    could feel the cross ribs of the cot below me right through the straw
    mattress and I adjusted my position to avoid the open areas. With minor
    corrections, I was able to establish the most comfortable position possible.
    Ah! Warm at last! What a glorious feeling that gave me such a grand feeling
    of contentment. All of my expectations for my future, at least in the short
    run, were reduced to having a bed to sleep in where I was warm and dry.
    Immediately, I dozed off to sleep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We looked forward to our first trip into the
    nearby town of Taunton. It was a very picturesque English town with a
    population of approximately thirty thousand people.<sup>3</sup> We were dropped off in
    an area away from the commercial center and this area was more like a
    village. It was really a suburb of the main town. The civilians tried to
    make us feel welcome, but there were so many GIs and British soldiers
    around, they just overwhelmed the place. The shops were off-limits to us, so
    there was nothing for us to buy. American MPs patrolled the streets to keep
    the peace if necessary but in the select little area we visited, they had
    little to do but check passes. One of the local churches had a little
    meeting room where they served punch and not much else. They also pushed us
    to attend their religious services, which turned us off to the place. We
    were told about an American Service Club on the grounds of Flook House off
    Station Road, but it was some distance from our drop off point and we never
    made it there. Near the end of our stay in this camp, Grimes told the rest
    of we crewmembers that although it was difficult to get to, the club held
    regular dances and was a great place to meet young ladies. "Now you
    tell us," cried Le Claire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The local pub near the area we visited most
    often was about fifteen feet square and was not off-limits. However, the
    local civilians would all get there early, and take it over so most of the
    soldiers could not get in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I took only a few trips into Taunton and
    don't remember it being more than a divergence. It was just something to do
    to break up the monotony of the camp routine. To get back to the camp from
    town, we loaded up on the trucks in a courtyard of a large building. As we
    were leaving, the headlights of the trucks would sweep across the walls of
    the yard. They would pick up about a dozen GIs who had their British girl
    friends pinned up against the walls getting their last kisses goodnight and
    anything else they could maneuver in a standing position. Neither the cold
    weather nor the public viewing seemed to have any effect on the couples.
    Occasionally, the driver would stop the truck for a minute or so with the
    headlights illuminating the amorous couples. It would produce a backlash of
    obscenities from the GIs at the wall, but the driver got his kicks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From talking to the local citizens in
    Taunton, we learned about the many ways they had prepared for the worst
    possible situation to happen, especially early in the war when they were
    fighting the Germans alone. They had all been issued gas masks and great
    effort was made to distribute the proper material to each house to make
    blackout drapes. Public air raid shelters were designated in churches and
    other public buildings. An invasion committee had been established. Plans
    for resistance were drawn in case of an invasion. Plans and materials to
    construct a temporary bridge over the river were made in case the Tone
    Bridge was destroyed. The Home Guard was trained to fight the enemy. They
    dragged large tree branches into large flat fields to prevent gliders from
    landing. They learned how to make Molotov cocktails in expectations of
    German tanks. Concrete tank stops were placed at the entrances to town.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Taunton also accommodated many thousands of
    women, children and infant refugees from London who were escaping the German
    blitz on that city earlier in the war. In such a high alert status, it was
    no wonder the local farmers were reluctant to furnish us with information
    about the locations of military camps or towns.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The British soldiers, or Brits as we called
    them (when we were mad at them for something, we called them Limeys), really
    had it tough. They were paid about one-quarter the amount for the equivalent
    rank of the GIs, and their uniforms left a lot to be desired. They were made
    from coarse wool material and looked like they would be quite uncomfortable,
    although I am sure that they became accustomed to them. Each enlisted man
    had only one uniform he worked in all day; then he went out on passes
    wearing the same one. There was some bantering back and forth among the
    Brits and GIs. They would tell us, "The trouble with you Yanks is that
    you're overpaid, oversexed, and over here." We would reply by telling
    them; "You're just sore because you're underpaid, undersexed, and under
    Eisenhower." Overall, however, we all got along quite well except in
    one area. The Americans were dating most of the local girls in town, and
    this did not go over well with the Brits. Several of our soldiers told us
    the local girls showed them pictures of GIs from our camp they had dated
    prior to our arrival. They were all blacks. The Southerners, or Rebels as we
    called them, had a difficult time accepting this fact. Unlike the American
    soldiers, some of whom had not left their prejudices back home, the British
    people were mainly color-blind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Christmas was not a very happy time,
    especially for the married soldiers. There were not many packages from home,
    and even the letters were slow in arriving. The packages that did arrive
    gave us a temporary lift even though they usually contained very stale
    cookies. At least they were a reminder of home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On Christmas Eve, our crewmembers sat around
    the cold, damp and gloomy Nissen hut as we had done every other day. We had
    no radio, newspapers, or decorations, and the few magazines that had come
    from the States were at least a month old. Also, it was almost impossible to
    read by the minimal light emitted by low-wattage bulbs hanging from the
    ceiling. We took a deck of cards, cut out letters to spell Merry Christmas,
    and strung them up across the room. Everyone talked and tried to make light
    of the situation, but it was a very bleak and lonely time. When we took the
    sign down, we each took a letter and vowed to meet back in civilian life
    after the war and show each other the cards. It would remind us of how not
    to spend Christmas Eve.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On Christmas Day we had turkey and all the
    trimmings for dinner, but they ran out of pie before our crew got served.
    There was not even a religious service. Someone said the chaplain was on
    furlough. I spent most of the day thinking about home and wondering what my
    family was doing to celebrate. I tried to visualize the decorated tree and
    the meal they were having. The day turned out to be about as dismal as the
    previous evening.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">New Year's Eve and Day passed with nary a
    mention of their significance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Rumors and More Rumors</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Battle of the Bulge was raging over on
    the continent, and the news we were getting was quite ominous. Rumors about
    our future were rampant, and there seemed to be a new one every day. One
    rumor was we were going to France to join a new Army-the rumormongers had
    even given it a number, the 15th-that was being formed to fight the
    advancing Germans. Another rumor had us being broken up and sent to Europe
    as replacements for infantry units. Because of the vast number of men who
    were killed or captured in the Bulge, many replacements were needed. Still
    another rumor said we were going over as antiaircraft; only we would be
    given armor-piercing shells for anti-tank warfare. We scoffed at this latter
    rumor but it seemed more real when we started to get tank recognition
    classes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The rumors about our being broken up and made
    into a line outfit were the most persistent, and word was now coming down
    from Headquarters Battery that the colonel in charge of our battalion had
    called the battery captains to a meeting regarding our situation. Still,
    they were only rumors. At one assembly, we were told the colonel was trying
    to find a target range where we could practice shooting with our rifles. It
    had been about a year since we had originally qualified with them in the
    Mojave Desert. This seemed to indicate the threat of being broken up might
    have some validity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">None of the rumors came to pass, however, and
    by late January, 1945, the news from Europe started to get better. The
    advancing German army in the Ardennes Forest had been pushed back. General
    George Patton and his Third Army stopped its push into southern Germany, and
    a big part of their armor was sent to the Ardennes battle. The weather had
    cleared on the continent, and the Allied air forces were able to decimate
    the advancing German army from the air. These factors, along with a lot of
    reinforcements thrown into the battle led to the closing of the bulge. Many
    Americans were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. It was one of the
    costliest battles of the war.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The rumors regarding our unit being broken up
    subsided, and we felt more confident we would remain as an antiaircraft
    outfit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A fellow from another gun section who was a
    friend of my friend, Charlie Knock, had a nervous breakdown. As part of my
    regular duties, I was assigned to watch him. I sat on a cot with the butt of
    my unloaded M-1 rifle sitting on the floor between my legs as I faced the
    patient lying on his bunk about ten feet away. We were the only two men in
    this Nissen hut. I tried to talk with him, but he was completely out of his
    mind. I made a point of learning his wife's name and invoked it in my mainly
    one-sided conversation, but he did not even seem to recognize it. He talked
    to me several times but I had no idea what his words meant. It was the first
    time I had encountered a person with mental problems on a personal level-not
    counting my four hours of guard duty in the psychiatric ward of a hospital
    back in Camp Haan-and I found the experience quite unsettling. I believed at
    the time what had tipped him over the edge was the boring and monotonous
    life we were living in this remote camp. While some GIs looked upon the many
    idle hours as a pleasant opportunity to avoid work, others with more
    spirited minds found it insufferable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the older GIs in our outfit, before
    the war this man had worked for a large advertising agency in New York. I
    don't remember his name, but I know that Charlie sometimes referred to him
    as the battery intellectual. He rubbed the noncoms and some of the officers
    the wrong way by openly indicating they were thick-witted. Showing any sign
    of intelligence was dangerous enough in the Army, but flaunting it was
    unforgivable. He had paid a heavy penalty for his attitude during training.
    Things had gotten a little better for him when he became part of a gun
    section and was exposed less to higher ranking authority. It was very
    difficult for him to adapt to the inequalities and inefficiencies of the
    Army. This could be said about all of us, but it was much harder for the
    older men who had responsible jobs before entering service. They had been a
    part of businesses run in a much more democratic and efficient manner, and
    most of them could not completely accept what the Army had to offer. They
    took everything much too seriously. We younger men looked upon our military
    life with a more obedient and subservient attitude that came from our lack
    of experience. It made the rigors of everyday life more bearable. To put it
    another way, we didn't know any better.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After about a week of lying on a cot in an
    empty Nissen hut and being watched around the clock, they shipped the man to
    a hospital in London. We never saw nor heard about him again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a lot of sickness going around. The
    flu was prevalent, and it usually hit the older men the hardest. We would
    bring them food from the mess hall to save them the trip. For the latrine,
    they would walk out of our back door and down a little hill, and kick a hole
    in the snow for their deposit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>An Opportunity To Visit London</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sometime in January, I got a four-day pass
    and went to London with two of my buddies, Joe Bernal and Glen Le Claire. We
    had a wonderful time. We stayed in a private home near Marble Arch in the
    area known as the West End, here all the houses on the block abut one
    another. There was no front yard as we were used to in the States, and the
    front door opened right onto the public sidewalk. We saw the sights of the
    town all day and usually well into the night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" hspace="10" alt="German V-2 Rocket" vspace="10" src="images/V2_Rocket_12_69b.jpg" width="179" align="right" height="426">The German Air Force had caused great
    destruction in London and killed thousands of people during "the
    Blitz", but the air raids had ended by the time I arrived there. Some
    time before, the Germans had moved the bulk of their air power over to the
    Russian front in the east, and had resorted to firing V-1 and V-2 rockets at
    London. Still, London looked like a city at war. There were military
    personnel everywhere we went, posters encouraging civilians to give their
    utmost for the war effort, and remnants of the destruction done by the
    German air attacks. Most of the bomb damage was in the East End (the
    industrial section of the city). Where we were, there was a lot less damage,
    and the British people had done a good job of cleaning up most of the
    rubble. Years later, when I would see movies or news reels of the great
    damage London had experienced, I wondered how it could have been repaired in
    such a short time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after I had gone to bed one evening, the
    screaming of an air raid siren followed by an explosion awakened me. Someone
    came into our sleeping area and said a V-2 rocket had hit nearby<br>
    (See Fig. 69b). I heard
    many more sirens, but I never saw the damage where the rocket hit. It may
    have been one of the last of the V-1 and V-2 bombs to rain down on London
    because they discontinued sometime in January 1945.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Along the streets, many of the buildings,
    monuments, and Underground (subway) entrances still had sandbags in place<br>
    (See Fig. 69c).
    The Underground had been the main air-raid shelter for civilians during the
    German blitzkrieg. All the buildings in London still had blackout drapes
    that were drawn tight every evening despite the diminished number of air
    raids recently. The Home Guard was still active, and they checked <img border="0" hspace="8" alt="London - Sandbagged Police Station" vspace="10" src="images/London_Sandbagged_Police_Station_12_69c.jpg" width="338" align="left" height="542"> nightly to
    make sure their district was totally blacked out (See Fig. 69d). We found out about this
    one evening when an elderly man opened the front door of the home where we
    were staying and shouted, "Black it out!" He was wearing a British
    army steel helmet and a uniform that looked like leftovers from World War I.
    His swagger and military bearing were apparently the result of the pride he
    felt doing this job for the war effort.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In Hyde Park a large parcel of land where
    flowers had been grown before the war had been made into a vegetable garden.
    There were antiaircraft guns and searchlights in the park with troops
    manning them. They were in restricted areas to keep the operators from
    becoming distracted from their assignments by the many young women milling
    about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite wartime restrictions and harsh
    rationing of materials, civilians went about their daily business as though
    everything was normal. In fact, the Londoners and even those civilians we
    met back in Taunton had a certain assuredness about them. They had been
    fighting this war since September, 1939, more than two years before the
    Americans got involved. Even though they knew it was a long way from over,
    they felt the tide had turned and there could be no other conclusion but
    victory for them and their allies. This confidence emanated from everyone we
    met, as did the feeling this was a British war. While the Americans
    soldiers, (and certainly our equipment,) greatly outnumbered British, when
    talking to them they left us with the impression we were there just to help
    them out. However, they did have great respect for the American soldiers and
    even for the seemingly unlimited amount of planes, tanks, vehicles, and
    other supplies we furnished.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="London Home Guard during World War II" src ="images/London_Home_Guard_12_69d.jpg" width=600 height=519 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">London had a lot of clubs and places for the
    GIs to go, including some with dancing we attended hoping to meet young
    ladies. Some elderly men in some kind of auxiliary military uniform usually
    furnished the music.&nbsp; We would also go to the movies there. When the movie was over, we had to
    stand at attention while they played God Save the King, the British national
    anthem. We would always try and cut out early but the projectionist, who
    would anticipate this move, would start the music before the last scene of
    the movie was over.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite the tight blackout restrictions, an
    active nightlife went on in the city. We frequented a great service club
    near Piccadilly Square (See Fig. 69e). One evening while we were walking back to our
    quarters from this club, we ran into one of those heavy fogs for which
    London is famous. We had traveled this route before and thought we knew it
    well, but we got lost. There were few people on the street so we were
    climbing lampposts looking for signs to tell us what street we were on. It
    took us several hours to cover the distance we should have covered in just
    half an hour.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Picadilly Circus - London, during World War II" src ="images/Picadilly_Circus_World_War_II_12_69e.jpg" width=468 height=694 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My friends and I were still having a problem
    adapting to the room temperature British version of beer, so our trips to
    the pubs were limited. We were introduced to pints and haf-pints
    (half-pints) of ale instead of glasses of beer. Hard liquor like whiskey was
    almost impossible for enlisted men to get, although most of us younger men
    had not yet developed a taste for it so it was not missed. Most of the
    larger pubs were so crowded it was difficult to move around. The patrons
    were a mixture of GIs, British soldiers and civilians. The GIs were quite
    popular in these places because with a little bit of encouragement, they
    would buy a round for all the people around them. They also dispensed
    cigarettes generously. American cigarettes were in great demand. The GIs
    described the British cigarettes as a mixture of straw and dried manure.
    Their leading brand was called Players.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Near the end of our stay in London, we found a small pub that was not as
    crowded in an out-of-the-way place near where we were staying. The civilians
    would challenge us to dart games for a pint. It was amazing to see their
    skills improve during a game from what we had seen beforehand. However,
    losing was no big thing. The price of ale was rationed like everything else
    in Britain, and it was relatively cheap.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We visited all the sightseeing attractions
    including old churches, royal residences, government buildings, parks,
    historic sites, and bridges. Some of the artifacts had been removed from the
    museums and churches for safe keeping during the blitz.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another thing we would do was to go to the
    entrance to Hyde Park at the Marble Arch, near what was called the Speakers'
    Corner. There, we would heckle the soapbox orators who were spewing out
    their hate. Some of it was against their government, but most of it seemed
    to be aimed at the Irish and the Catholics, subjects about which I had my
    own strong beliefs. I guess Nazism, Fascism, and Communism were not problems
    with these people because they never mentioned them while we were there. We
    would harass the speakers verbally, then shake the little stands they were
    on to disrupt their orations. The Bobbies (British policemen), who were
    stationed nearby in anticipation of someone's drastic reaction to the fiery
    speeches, would come over and politely but firmly tell us to stop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While in London, I looked for a high-class
    restaurant where I could get a good meal. I knew that England had price
    restrictions on everything, including food in restaurants, so I wasn't too
    concerned about what it would cost. I talked Joe and Glenn into going with
    me. We picked out a very elegant-looking place with a doorman in the better
    part of town. We went in and ordered one of the more expensive entrees on
    the menu. What we wanted was a good steak, and the menu item we selected
    sounded like it was some kind of a good cut of beef. What we did not realize
    was there was no such thing served in English restaurants at that time. What
    we thought we ordered and what we got were two completely different things.
    The meat was a small roll that might be called a meat loaf except it was so
    loaded down with bread and other fillers it wasn't even meat colored. It
    came with a large dry potato, plain carrots, and cabbage. Everything but the
    meat had been boiled and nothing was seasoned. The portions were large and
    tasteless. The three of us struggled to eat the meal. Even water was being
    conserved in England so we had trouble getting refills of our tiny water
    glasses to wash the food down. There was also a shortage of waiters. Several
    large posters scattered around the restaurant stated, in effect, "The
    King doesn't waste food so you shouldn't either." After finishing about
    half of the meal, it took another half-hour to get our check. Finally, we
    got out of there and away from the dirty looks of other customers, who were
    all civilians. From then on, we stayed away from English restaurants. Joe
    Bernal commented, "We should have learned our lesson on our way over
    here on the Nieuw Amsterdam with the British cooks."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A few hours after our visit to the restaurant
    we found a street vendor selling fish and chips in a newspaper container
    rolled into a shape resembling a large ice cream cone. The chips were on the
    bottom with the fried fish on top. Despite the many-layered thickness of the
    cones, the grease flowed through it almost immediately but no meal ever
    tasted so good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">About a month after the first furlough, I got
    another three-day pass to London, and this time just Joe Bernal and I went.
    Most of the English people we met treated us with great kindness. Joe had
    distant relatives there, and, when we went to see them, they invited us for
    dinner. Even though they had strict rationing for all their food, they
    wanted to share it with us. The family consisted of a husband, a wife, and
    two young children. They lived in a small apartment they referred to as a
    flatlet. It was crammed with too much furniture so old it must have been
    passed down through several generations. As we sat at their dining room
    table talking and enjoying our meal, I thought about how amusing their
    accents sounded and how unfamiliar some of their expressions were. One of
    the children, a girl of about four years old, kept staring at me,
    especially, when I spoke. Finally, she said to her mother as she pointed at
    me, "Mommy, he talks funny." I guess we sounded as different to
    them as they did to us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The main course that evening was a rump roast
    that weighed less than two pounds and wasn't much bigger than my fist. We
    each got two small slices of it so we filled up on potatoes and cabbage -
    their main staples. After the meal, they told us the roast was the family
    ration of meat for the week. We offered them cigarettes, but they refused,
    so we left some without them knowing about it. Cigarettes, especially
    American cigarettes, were a real luxury, and in some ways, they were better
    than money. In those days almost everyone smoked, especially in England and,
    as we would learn later, on the Continent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was very little black market activity
    going on in England as far as we could see. The nearest thing to it was
    their bartering system. They wanted American fountain pens, wristwatches,
    and cigarettes, and went to great pains trying to find things to trade for
    them. The people took the war very seriously and put the war effort before
    their own needs. They had a tough time of it for many years, and yet the
    spirits of the people we met always seemed high.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after we got back to camp, Joe Bernal
    learned his brother had been killed in action in Europe. Joe had talked a
    lot about him when we were sharing a pup tent in the Mojave Desert. His
    brother had been a member of a tank crew and was killed in the Battle of the
    Bulge. Because Joe was the only other child in the family, he was offered a
    chance to go home. I don't remember if it was for a furlough or if it was to
    be permanent, but he elected to stay with us. He became very quiet for a
    long period of time, and we just let him alone with his thoughts. Most of us
    had a hard time trying to think of something to say to him so we said
    nothing. There wasn't a word said by anyone in authority from our outfit
    either, which did not surprise us. He wrote many letters home and received
    many himself. There was no telephone to talk to his family directly so his
    letters were his only link to them. Many years later, I thought, what a
    miserable way to mourn for a loved one. I also wished I had said many things
    to him I hadn't.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the many questions we had while at
    this camp was, "Where is our heavy equipment like the 40mm guns,
    directors, M-51 mounts, and two-and-a-half trucks?" There was no sign
    of them and in keeping with Army tradition, nobody in authority made any
    effort to explain their absence. We had assumed they had been shipped from
    California and would arrive any time. After we were in England for almost
    three months, we were finally notified we would be receiving all new
    equipment. When it arrived, we cleaned the Cosmoline from the guns,
    lubricated the joints, lightly oiled the breeches, and prepared them for
    operations. A deadly accident occurred during this time of preparation. One
    of the crew chiefs of another gun section was killed when hit in the head by
    a gun barrel during a normal disassembling procedure. He would be our
    battalion's first casualty but definitely not the last.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The trucks were loaded up with sand bags,
    shovels, picks, tents, cots, and many other items we had brought with us
    from the States.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Near the end of our stay at this camp, our
    gun section had a change in personnel. Cogdill was sent back to the States
    for personal reasons. The specific reason was never explained. A fellow
    named Wold was brought in to replace him. He had been attached to
    Headquarters Battery for some time and we all knew him, if only slightly.
    His easygoing manner and positive attitude helped him blend in with the
    other crewmembers in a hurry. We liked to kid him about his Kentucky accent
    that seemed to vary in intensity depending on the situation. In slow
    conversations during quiet times, it was heavy while during active
    situations it was barely noticeable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We assumed since we now had all of our
    weapons in hand it would not be too long before we would be shipped over to
    the continent. Things were not getting any better at this camp, and we were
    anxious to leave, even if it meant going over where the war was still going
    strong. We had been training for a long time, yet nothing was happening. The
    delay in being called to serve in the war zone was creating frustration
    among us and there was even a sizeable amount of guilt. Getting over to
    continental Europe looked like a better alternative to the boredom we were
    experiencing. We felt we could make a difference in the war effort because
    we were well trained and eager to show our skills. What we were hearing
    about the war was only news bulletins, and the full significance of the
    horrors did not fully register. We hadn't a clue what it would feel like to
    experience combat. Our shortsightedness went only as far as the limits of
    our miserable camp in southwestern England. If we had thought about it
    objectively, perhaps our concern would have been different. Maybe that's the
    way the Army got you ready to fight wars. Make the safe camps so miserable
    anything else looks better; at least from a distance. The Nissen hut we
    lived in had become so depressing we could barely tolerate it on good days.
    We fought off somber thoughts on the many bad ones. As a gun section, our
    morale had hit a new low. In hindsight, we should have been happy we were
    not over on the continent. But you see things only from your own
    perspective, and from our viewpoint, we wanted to be anyplace but Camp
    Stapley.</font></p>
