    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">MP duty was interesting and often exciting.
    Our uniform consisted of a helmet liner, dress uniform, a gun belt with a
    loaded .45 caliber pistol and an extra clip of ammunition. We carried a
    baton (club) that was lead weighted. The helmet liner was stenciled in front
    with the letters MP, and we wore a black armband on our left sleeve with
    white letters MP stitched on it (See Fig. 172a). I had some prior experience
    firing a .45 caliber pistol, but most of the men had not. The baton was a
    very lethal weapon, and we were instructed to use it with care. That bit of
    information was the only training we got on how to act as an MP.</font></p>

    nightstick . . ."</div>
    
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a special investigative division in
    our battalion that worked closely with the Belgian police and the British
    MPs. Sergeant Mellencamp of our battery's second platoon was in charge of
    it, and they handled the more serious crimes like rape, murder, and major
    black market crimes. The rest of us handled the less serious cases and
    turned the ones needing more investigative or prosecution work over to that
    division. Our headquarters was a building in downtown Antwerp. It also had a
    section that was used as a jail. We would go out in two-man crews from 2000
    hours in the evening until 0200 hours the next morning. Sometimes it was on
    foot patrol, and other times we drove a Jeep. It soon became apparent our
    main challenges were to check passes, stop fights, pick up drunken GIs who
    could not navigate on their own, soothe abused saloonkeepers, and try to
    keep peace in general. Without any instruction on exactly how to handle
    specific situations, each crew developed their own style.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We knew putting on the symbols of an MP would
    automatically make us unpopular with most GIs. This dislike (or hatred in
    some cases) resulted from personal experiences and from horror stories about
    some harsh treatment being handed out. Perhaps the greatest underlying
    reason was the feeling MPs were an extension of the military that reached
    out of the camps where we were and infringed on our free time. Because most
    of the men in our outfit understood and sympathized with this feeling, we
    made minimum effort to enforce military courtesy, uniform violations, or
    other minor infringements of military codes. For example, if we saw a GI
    with his tie off, we would just<img border="0" alt="MP Arm Band" src ="images/Military_Police_Arm_Band_28_172a.jpg" width=400 align=right height=331 > yell at him to put it on. There was no
    effort made to make sure the dress code was enforced by arrest or
    detainment. A few of the MPs broke the unwritten rule by spending most of
    the evening checking passes and bringing those without one or with outdated
    ones into the station. They were soon labeled the chicken s--- detail. The
    rest of us felt our major assignment was limited to keeping law and order.
    This could be a major problem on some nights, especially right after payday
    when money flowed freely and drinking was at its peak. We soon found the
    easiest way to get through an evening of duty without some physical
    confrontation was to practice the art of diplomacy and not rule with an iron
    hand. Most of us liked the challenges of keeping men from fighting and
    mediating the sometime chaotic experiences in the bars. However, we were not
    always successful at mediation and we had to enforce the law.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The town was full of GIs who were celebrating
    the fact they were going home and who were enjoying their last fling in
    Europe. In addition to the American soldiers from Camp Tophat, there were
    Canadians, British, Australian, Palestinians Jews, and soldiers from other
    countries. Because Antwerp is a port city, there were also merchant marine
    sailors from ships around the world. The mixture of people from different
    countries with their predispositioned prejudices was the primary cause of
    trouble. Mix in the alcoholic state resulting from the heavy traffic in
    cafes, and you can see why the MPs were kept busy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I was in more fights in Antwerp than in my
    whole life elsewhere. However, because I had a baton and a gun, the fights
    were heavily weighted in my favor and I never fretted about the eventual
    outcome. I had something else going for me. My partner on most nights was a
    guy named Dominic Nucci who had been in another gun section in our battery.
    I didn't know him until we started to pull this MP duty. He was of average
    height and weight. and quite an unassuming person. He wore glasses, and he
    looked more like a high school honor student than an MP. However,
    appearances were deceiving in this case. Before the war, he had been a CYO
    (Catholic Youth Organization) boxing champion in New York City and was as
    tough as they came.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many of the incidents we had to settle
    started with a bar owner phoning in a complaint to our headquarters.
    Sometimes he would just go out in the street looking for us. We knew where
    to patrol because most of the problems started in the seedier bar area of
    town.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While we were armed to the teeth, in most
    cases the gun and club were not of much use to us. What we really should
    have had was a training course in psychology. We certainly did not want to
    shoot or club some fellow GI when he was drunk-ninety-nine percent of the
    cases involved drunks-unless we were under violent attack. A good course in
    jujitsu would also have helped immensely in the execution of our policemen
    duties. Most fracases started with a shouting match, deteriorating to some
    pushing and shoving before a full-fledged fight would develop. If we could
    not settle it peacefully, we would hold one or more ringleaders until
    further help came. We would then load them into a two-and-a-half ton truck
    for the trip back to headquarters. However, most of the time we turned the
    troublemakers loose, and because of that we started to get heat from the
    brass. They heard stories about things that happened on the street, but
    there were only a few prisoners being brought in. Also, in some cases, shop
    owners who had their places of business torn up came to our headquarters
    seeking restitution for damages done by soldiers and there wasn't even a
    report on the incident.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One evening Dominic and I were called to a
    bar where three British merchant marine seamen were tearing up the place.
    There were no British MPs around so we were left to handle the situation. We
    subdued them and loaded them into the back of our Jeep. On the way to the
    British MP station, they convinced us they were nice guys, and we decided to
    take them out to the docks where their ship was berthed. In most cases,
    except the most extreme ones, we were the police, judge, and jury. On the
    way out to the docks with the three sailors, they got belligerent again and
    started to hit us on the back of our heads with their fists. Dominic, who
    was driving, stopped the Jeep along the side of the road, and we got out to
    fight. Dominic had two of them on the ground in about a minute, even though
    they were both considerably bigger than him. He then stood and watched me
    wrestle on the wet ground with the third one. Finally, Nucci and I got back
    into the Jeep without our seamen and headed back into town. The Brits were
    shouting at us "You bloody this," and "You bloody that,"
    until we got out of earshot. Despite their use of the word bloody, it didn't
    have the effect on GIs it was intended to have. Dominic was laughing at me
    because my uniform was covered with mud and I was openly expressing my
    displeasure with the Limeys. My lower lip was beginning to swell from a
    punch I had received in the brawl. I kept asking myself why I had been so
    hesitant about using my club. We both pledged to not be so nice the next
    time we picked up someone for a violation, but it was not very long before
    we went back to our old habits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had no radios in our Jeeps, so we used our
    sirens for signals. If a major incident arose, it was usually phoned into
    our MP headquarters and a Jeep would be dispatched. The Jeep from
    headquarters would open up the siren and hold it open for the whole trip.
    All the other MPs in the area would converge on the location of the sound.
    One evening, Dominic and I were touring the downtown district. I was driving
    when we heard a siren screaming across town. I picked up speed and came out
    of a side street onto De Keyserlei Street, where I made a turn. It had been
    raining, and the brick streets were as slick as glass. Our Jeep skidded all
    the way across the street, and we bounced off the curb of a streetcar safety
    island filled with people. As I straightened out the vehicle, I looked back
    at the civilians standing on the island. They were all shouting at us, but
    it did not appear anyone had been hurt. We kept on going.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived at the Broadway Café, the most
    notorious trouble spot in the city. The Jeep we assumed had used the siren
    earlier was parked out in front. We ran inside the crowded bar and saw two
    MPs standing in the middle of the dance floor where about a dozen British
    soldiers were tearing their uniforms off. The MPs had lost their batons and
    their shirts were torn down over their gun belts, so they could not reach
    their guns. We waded into the fight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Almost immediately, someone hit me on the
    head from behind, and I went down on my hands and knees. I was dazed but the
    hard kick in the ribs I received as soon as I fell reminded me the worst
    place I could be was on the floor. I stood up and turned, swinging my
    nightstick as hard as I could at a likely candidate for the one who sent me
    down. In my rage, I was swinging for his head, but he threw his shoulder up,
    and I hit that instead. He went tumbling to the floor, yelling in pain and
    reaching for his wounded shoulder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By this time, more MPs were coming through
    the front door, and the fight was starting to balance in our favor. One of
    the two original MPs had finally gotten his torn clothes off his holster,
    and he pulled his gun. I knew what was going to happen next because he was a
    real hothead. He had been yelling above everyone else in the melee,
    "I'll kill you, you Limey bastard! I'll kill you!" Evidently, his
    use of the singular meant he had one particular British soldier in mind. He
    cocked the gun and then leveled it at one of the British soldiers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Before he fired, someone pushed the gun to
    the side, and his shot hit a mirror, which shattered with a terrible crash
    all over the dance floor. That stopped most of the action. Even the one who
    did the shooting was startled. Someone yelled something to him, but he did
    not fire again although he continued to wave the gun around, threatening to
    shoot British soldiers. It made the rest of us MPs nervous because we knew
    of his fiery temper and the gun did not have the safety on. He was starting
    to hit the Brits with it, and we knew it would not take much of a jolt to
    make it go off again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we finally got control, we lined up MPs
    through the cafe and out to the street, where we now had a truck to haul the
    Brits into the station. As they passed the line of MPs, we would give each
    of them a jab with the end of our clubs. Many of them would be knocked to
    the street outside, where four MPs would pick them up and throw them on to
    the steel slats lining the truck floor. Some of them were quite beat up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Nucci
    had been doing his thing during the fight with a lot of success but he paid
    a heavy price. One of his hands was badly cut when he got it mixed up with
    the teeth of one of the Brits. He was taken to the hospital for stitched
    along with another GI who got hurt in the melee.</span></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Back at the station, a British officer
    arrived to complain about our brutality. Standing next to him was the
    soldier I had hit on the arm, now swollen to about twice its normal size. He
    had his jacket off and his shirtsleeve was slit to allow for the swelling.
    At this point I had cooled down, and I was sure glad I had missed his head.
    He was pointing me out to the officer, so I cut out a back door and left the
    station. My ribs were hurting something awful from the kick I received in
    the fight and I debated going to the hospital. I decided against it. I never
    heard anything more about the situation that night. The pain in my ribs took
    about a week to subside.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We frequently visited the Army-sponsored
    clubs set up for the entertainment of GIs. The picture below (Fig.172b)
    shows the inside of one. I met this girl there and after drinking for
    several hours, I asked her if I could walk her home. She agreed and we left
    the club. We were near a large square that was well lit up with several
    streets leading into it. She walked up to one of the streets that was very
    narrow and dark. She told me to wait in the square while she went home for
    something. She walked down the street and was out of sight after entering
    about ten feet of the street. I waited for about twenty minutes but she
    never returned so I figured I was jilted. About a week later I ran into her
    when I was driving around in a jeep during MP duty. I stopped to ask her
    what happened and she became upset that I wasn't there when she returned.
    "I had to put the baby to bed," she said.&nbsp; That was the last
    time I saw her at my doing.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Antwerp Club - World War II" src ="images/Antwerp_Club_28_172b.jpg" width=698 height=607 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> From our MP duties, we knew where
    the best civilian cafes, some with entertainment, were located. Best often
    meant the ones with the least number of fights. They were all very busy
    places. One of the civilian cafes that specialized in food rather than drink
    would give any GI who wanted it free food because the American Army had
    liberated the owner from a German concentration camp. We went there
    occasionally, but we always paid. The proprietor extended particular
    attention to us MPs because we were there in Antwerp much longer than the
    transient GIs. We had to argue with him at the door every time when he
    wanted to tear up the check. We did not think that was a good reason to get
    a free meal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of my friends was dating a Belgian girl.
    He told several of us about her, and he mentioned she had a very short
    haircut. We all laughed and told him she had been a Nazi collaborator. When
    the Germans were driven out of Belgium by the Allied army, the Belgians
    shaved the heads of the women who had been too friendly with the Germans as
    a punishment for their fraternizing with the enemy. It might have been for
    just dating a soldier but usually it was because of a more intimate
    relationship. My friend was surprised to hear this, but it did not affect
    his love life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sometimes, when we were through with MP duty
    at 0200 hours, we would drive out to a small cafe located near the docks
    before going back to our barracks. They served us two eggs, a small steak,
    toast, and coffee for fifty cents. In addition to being cheap, even for
    those days, it tasted good. Also, it was a nice way to unwind after spending
    an evening on duty. One morning we went there and they were closed. Later,
    we heard the place had been shut down for selling horsemeat. The steaks were
    a little bit dry, but we had attributed that to the cheap price.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Red Light District</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As part of our duty when we were patrolling
    in a Jeep, we had to make trips to the red-light district, which we hated.
    The district is named Schipperskwartier (a Dutch name) that translated meant
    something like sailors quarter. It surrounds a square known as
    Sint-Jansplein (translated as St.Johns Square). The two main streets are
    Burggracht and Aneessenstraat.1 Because the GIs had trouble pronouncing the
    names, they made up their own versions that were easier to pronounce. For
    example, Schipperskwartier became Ships-Waiter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The area was down near the waterfront and
    drew heavily on the merchant mariners in addition to GIs for its business.
    Prostitution was legal in Antwerp, and all the girls were registered. They
    were subject to periodic checkups by the Belgian authorities to make sure
    they were clean. We kept our trips to that area to a minimum because it was
    a real hellhole. In one area, the cobblestone streets were only eight feet
    wide with a two-foot-wide sidewalk on one side of the street. The buildings
    were right up against the street on one side and next to the narrow sidewalk
    on the other. It was like driving in a cavern, and the lack of streetlights
    made it quite spooky at night. In most areas, the only light came through a
    window where a whore was sitting looking out. They always had the same pose
    and a fake smile. Some of the men walking along the street would cover their
    faces when we passed. I guess they didn't want to be recognized.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the same vicinity there were a number of
    seedy bars with men hawkers out in front trying to draw customers into their
    establishments. One of them stepped out in front of our moving Jeep to tell
    us something or to register a complaint. Nucci was driving, and he never
    even slowed down when he saw him. The man was barely able to get out of the
    way without being hit as we continued on. "I should have hit the
    pimp," he said to me. He had no tolerance for anyone in that area.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we were leaving the red-light district one
    evening after several unpleasant encounters, Nucci commented, "That
    place is a real whorehouse." When he realized the redundancy of his
    remark we both had a big laugh.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Whenever we had to go to the red-light
    district, we drove down the row of brothels as fast as we could without
    hitting someone. There was always someone-a soldier, a sailor, or a
    whore-trying to stop us with some kind of a problem. We stopped only when we
    saw blood, and not always then. It was a no-win situation every time,
    dealing with the low-lifers of society. There was no answer to most of their
    problems and, if there was, we did not have the training or time to solve
    them. Usually, we were asked by the victim of a crime to go and find someone
    who had robbed or beaten him or her. We did not know how to handle those
    problems, and we knew better than to bring criminals, even military ones,
    back to headquarters. There, they knew only how to lock up unruly drunks
    overnight and they had too many of them. We could have taken the victims to
    the investigative division but they, too, were badly overworked. We had been
    instructed by them to only bring in those individuals we could prove a case
    against. This we never had.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Port cities, or at least those parts near the
    docks are known for their unsavory neighborhoods, but Antwerp was probably
    worse than most. With all the military men in the area, many of whom were
    desperate for a good time, a whole bunch of new candidates to the lower rung
    of society was added to the mix.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Several of our MPs had been shot at in the
    red-light area, and there had been some vicious fights where several of our
    men got hurt. In one case, a jealous husband or boyfriend threw a corporal
    from our battalion out a second-story window. However, the incident had
    nothing to do with his military police duties. He was off duty at the time.
    When some of our men went to see him in the hospital, he was completely out
    of his mind, and we heard his wife was coming over from the States to be
    with him. We wondered why they were not shipping him back to the States.
    There was talk about prosecuting the offender, and the Army's provost was
    debating the merits of it. The problem was in how to protect the wife from
    the details. It was a real mess, but I never learned how it turned out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were British MPs and Belgium police who
    were also on duty in Antwerp, but we were the only ones who carried
    ammunition for our guns. If a really dangerous situation arose, they would
    call on us and then step back and let us do the dirty work. One such
    incident happened to me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One night while Dominic and I were driving in
    the red-light district, we came upon a mob of people. The British MPs were
    there. They told us they had received a report a British soldier had shot a
    gun at someone from the second story of the building where they were
    assembled. A British Lieutenant there suggested that, since we had loaded
    guns, we should go into the building first to see what was going on. Dominic
    and I went in the front door to the hall and up the dimly lit staircase. The
    walls were old and dirty; the uncarpeted stairs creaked badly. There was no
    chance we were going to sneak up on anybody. We had our .45's out, cocked
    with the safeties off. We were both very nervous and moving slowly. We
    hesitated at the landing and just outside of the apartment for about ten
    seconds each as if that was going to somehow help our situation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The door to the apartment where the shot had
    come from was ajar. We looked in, and, just past the entrance hall, in a
    bedroom, we saw what looked like a man in a uniform with a gun in his hand
    lying next to a bed. There was a considerable amount of blood on the bed and
    the floor. When we moved into the apartment, we found the man, who was a
    British officer, and his woman companion were both dead. It appeared he had
    killed her and then committed suicide. At least, that's what it looked like
    to us. We decided to let the British officer figure it out. We yelled out
    the window for the Brits to come up. As we passed the British MPs in the
    hallway on our way down, one of them looked at us and said sarcastically,
    "Good show, mate. You did a bloody good job of it and without going
    bang, bang with those big cannons of yours."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Dominic responded, "Next time I'll give
    you my gun and we'll see how you do you Limey sonofabitch."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Brit turned as if to start a
    confrontation, so I pulled Dominic by the arm to get him out of there. The
    Brit never knew what a favor I did for him. We left the area immediately,
    even though the lieutenant had told us to hang on, which we assumed meant
    stick around. We figured if he wanted us badly enough, he could find us back
    at headquarters. Going into that building turned out to be an anticlimactic
    event, but walking up those stairs to an unknown but potentially dangerous
    situation was another reminder why we did not like the red-light district.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While driving back to town in our Jeep, we
    discussed why we hadn't thought about giving the Brits our guns to go into
    the building. We debated about reporting the incident to Sergeant
    Mellencamp's investigative department and decided to let the Brits tell him
    if they thought it was necessary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Kilroy</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a strange phenomenon going on
    during and after the war, wherever there were GIs present. It was especially
    prevalent in debarkation ports like Antwerp. The expression, Kilroy Was
    Here, was written on any public display that was accessible, and nobody knew
    who did it (See Fig. 173a). A cartoon drawing of a long-nosed smurf-like
    character peering over a fence usually<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Kilroy was here" vspace="8" src="images/Kilroy_28_173.jpg" width="300" align="left" height="327"> accompanied it. The idea was for
    someone to find that short sentence, and sometimes the cartoon, in a place
    it would be least suspected. The original intent was to place it in a
    location such as a forward battlefield position where new arrivals would be
    surprised to see it. But it soon lost the surprise element and became a game
    where everybody was doing it. It would be in latrines, in among Army papers,
    on the pages of books, in church, on the side of a bus, on the bottom of a
    ship's bunk, and anywhere else you could think of. It was not unusual to see
    it written thirty or forty times in a day. It was graffiti gone amuck. The
    whole concept made no sense at all, but I guess that was the idea. There
    were many rumors about who had started the craze and legends even sprung up
    about it. The legend that seemed to be the most persistent gave the
    credit-blame might be a better word-for the first Kilroy Was Here to a
    shipyard inspector named Kilroy back in the States.</font></p>

    to Brussels half a dozen times. I saw most of the sights in these countries
