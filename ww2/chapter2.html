    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In early June, 1943, my number came up, and I
    was notified that I had been "selected" - an euphemism for
    "drafted" - to serve in the military services. Knowing that I was
    finally going was more a relief than anything else. I had been ready for a
    long time and the act of doing it just seemed routine. Routine! There would
    be nothing routine about what I was about to experience for the better part
    of the next three years of my life.</font></p>

    <p><img border="0" alt="Camp Grant" src ="images/Camp_Grant_2_14.jpg" width=500 height=334 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On June 22nd, I said good-bye to my mother,
    sister Joan, and younger brother Bill at home. My father drove me to the
    local draft board at 79th Street and Exchange Avenue at 0600 hours. He
    kissed me on the cheek as he said good-bye. There were tears in his eyes. It
    was the only time that he kissed me as an adult. He had been in the Navy
    during World War I and he knew better than I what I was getting into. My
    mother had not come with us so she could do her crying out of sight. I
    realized these good-byes meant the end of everything important to me. There
    would be no more participation in the things I had learned to enjoy in
    civilian life. But it was not something I dwelled on. It never occurred to
    me I would not return when the war was over to enjoy them all again, even
    though I had no good reason for being that optimistic. Like all young people
    then, now, and forever, the thought of dying was not something that worried
    me, even when entering military service during a worldwide war. I thought I
    was invincible and I had complete faith in my destiny. Others more
    knowledgeable might have viewed my optimism more harshly. Ignorance is
    bliss.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We potential recruits stood on the sidewalk
    outside the draft board and talked about what was going to happen to us.
    Everyone tried to put on the best face they could, but there was an
    underlying feeling of unrest. We never entered the building. A civilian
    showed up in about an hour and checked off the names of all who were there.
    Then busses arrived; we were loaded aboard and driven to a building downtown
    in the Chicago Loop. It was there we had our physical examinations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first order of the day was for everyone
    to strip down to his shorts. We were all in one big room on the second floor
    of the building. There were long lines snaking around for each test. After
    completing a test, we moved to the line for the next one. The temperature in
    the room was in the nineties and the body odor in some areas was formidable.
    There was no air conditioning, the open windows only let in heat and noise.
    The building backed up to Van Buren Street, one of the busier streets in the
    Loop and the elevated trains ("L") ran right past the uncovered
    windows. The "L" made a lot of the noise, and the passengers saw
    more nudity than a busy nudist camp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were fingerprinted. We gave blood and
    urine; then were examined thoroughly. We were told to get into the most
    embarrassing positions to be examined by flashlight. At this point, we had
    abandoned the shorts, and it was all done while stark naked in front of
    hundreds of others who were similarly exposed. The whole process was
    intimidating.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After dressing, we lined up in front of desks
    to be interrogated by psychiatrists. At least, they said they were
    psychiatrists. Some of them looked so bored we expected them to drop their
    heads and fall into a deep sleep. The questions they asked me were not new
    to me; they had been repeated many times by men in our neighborhood who had
    preceded me into service.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the psychiatrist asked, "Do you
    like girls?" I passed up an opportunity to spend the war as a civilian.
    The story about one of the neighborhood eccentrics who was asked this
    question became an urban legend. His reply was simply, "No, and they
    don't like me either." It kept him out of the service, and we all
    kidded about using the line ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">However, I really didn't want to be a
    civilian, and I answered "yes." In my neighborhood, to claim you
    didn't like girls was asking for more grief than being in the service could
    ever afford. In addition to peer pressure from my friends, more than a
    little of my own pride was involved. The thing that was foremost on my mind
    was to fulfill my dream of becoming a pilot, and I could only do that by
    going into service.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were tested for about three hours; most of
    the time was spent waiting in lines. The waiting was an introduction to what
    we would do hundreds of times in the future. Near the end, they asked us
    which branch of the service we wanted, Army or Navy. I said Army, but for
    some reason, they stamped my papers "Navy." I didn't notice it at
    the time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some men were rejected; given the draft
    classification of 4-F and sent home. The rest of us were separated by branch
    of service prior to being sworn in. Only then did I notice what was stamped
    on my application form. I immediately went back, and with some difficulty,
    had myself reassigned to the Army. I came very close to spending my military
    time in the Navy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were bussed to Camp Grant, near Rockford,
    Illinois (See Fig. 14), a camp set up to process new recruits. We were taken
    to a warehouse where we exchanged our civilian clothes for Army uniforms. We
    had been told to wear old clothes to the induction center because, if we
    were&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">accepted, the civilian clothes would not be
    returned. Because the weather was warm, we dressed in our new
    Government-issued khaki uniforms and wore them around the camp. We were also
    issued one set of wool olive drab (OD) uniforms and a set of fatigues. It
    was good that we did not have to wear the wool uniform immediately because
    it reeked of mothballs. The khakis were stiff, in most cases ill fitting,
    and they had a shine to them. They made us look like the raw recruits we
    were. As we looked around at the noncoms attached to the camp with their
    tailored uniforms adorned with chevrons, brightly colored shoulder patches
    on the sleeves of their shirts, and campaign ribbons across their chest, we
    felt completely ungarnished. We were anxious to get our khakis washed to
    remove the shine and to get some kind of shoulder patch sewn on our sleeve
    so we would look more like seasoned soldiers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were issued two metal identification tags
    (See Fig. 15) called dog tags, with some basic information on them. Mine
    included my army identification number (36669474), my blood type (O), and a
    "C" that indicated I was Catholic.<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Dogtags" vspace="10" src="images/Dogtags_2_15.jpg" width="350" align="right" height="410">
    The tags were primarily for identification in case I was killed or wounded.
    For the duration of my time in the service, I wore these tags every day and
    night attached to a chain around my neck. We signed up for a free $10,000
    life insurance policy to be paid in case of death while in service. I named
    my mother as beneficiary; her name also appeared on my dog tags.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we first got to camp, we were greeted by
    soldiers who had been in the army a short time, probably a day or two. They
    shouted at us in unison, "You'll be sorry!" or
    "Suckers!" We did the same thing after we had donned our new
    uniforms and were marched past the latest recruits stepping off their buses
    in civilian clothes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We lived in white two-story wooden barracks.
    Each building was exactly the same as the next, and they were even spaced
    the same distance apart. The only way to differentiate one from another was
    to check the small number stenciled over the outside doors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Inside, double-decked bunk beds about five
    feet apart lining each side of an aisle on both floors. At the foot of each
    bunk was a footlocker for our clothing (See Fig. 16).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was not a picture on the wall, rug on
    the floor, curtain on a window, a chair to sit on, a piece of furniture
    other than the metal bunk beds, or even a light fixture covering the bare
    light bulbs. The barracks had the antiseptic look of some futuristic testing
    lab; the sameness made everything look amazingly clean.</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Army Bunks" vspace="8" src="images/Army_Bunks_2_16.jpg" width="350" align="left" height="281"><font face="Arial" size="3">
    We were to find out cleanliness was a by-product of what was at play here.
    The sterile look was primarily to encourage conformity; comfort and beauty
    were not considerations. The emphasis on conformity was about to become a
    major factor in our lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the ends of the buildings were the
    latrines and individual quarters for the noncoms (noncommissioned officers)
    who were about to give us a taste of what army life was going to be like.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were marched to an in-camp barbershop and
    given army haircuts. It was a high-production operation with about twenty
    chairs and civilian barbers lined up in one row. My barber had a lit
    cigarette dangling from his lips through most of the time I was in the chair
    and he made no effort to turn when he blew out the smoke. The rumor was the
    Army was paying him on piecework. We learned not to specify how we wanted
    our hair cut. There was only one way, the Army way. The barbers ran the
    clippers up the sides of our heads and then chopped away the hair on top.
    The resulting bad haircuts added to our image as a bunch of raw recruits.
    Along with the new uniforms, we were being molded into the conformity of
    military fashion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I drew KP (kitchen police) duty and spent a
    whole day doing menial jobs in the kitchen. I peeled potatoes, served meals,
    scrubbed tables, mopped floors, and washed dishes. The duty lasted from sun
    up to sun down. They kept us busy every minute of the time and it was hot as
    blazes in the mess hall. The mess sergeant referred to us KPs as "you
    boys," and we noticed his efficiency in being right there whenever we
    completed one task so that he could be ready to assign the next one. The
    only breaks came when we were eating, and we had hardly been seated when the
    sergeant bellowed, "You're not civilians anymore so get a move
    on."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Near the end of the day, I was cleaning up
    the large pots and pans with another guy. The soapy water was laden with
    food particles, and was not doing a good job of cutting the grease despite
    the stiff GI brush I used. Even the rinse water was anything but clear. My
    fatigues were soaked from a combination of sweat and wash water. I was
    feeling very sorry for myself, thinking this pots-and-pans detail was the
    worst job in the kitchen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Then I noticed what was going on behind the
    sinks where the grease traps were being cleaned. This KP job made all the
    other duties seem like a picnic in the park. Usually two men were assigned
    to it and the work was guaranteed to make at least one lose his dinner.
    Fortunately, I was not selected, but the foul odor wafting throughout the
    mess hall just about gagged all the rest of us. Later, while doing the final
    clean up for the day, another fellow and myself were told to take a garbage
    can full of waste outside. As we walked out of the mess hall door carrying
    the can, we came across one of the men who had been on grease trap duty
    sitting on the wooden steps. His face was as white as a sheet. He shuffled
    over to the side of the step to let us pass but did not look up at us. The
    fatigue cap on his head was being pulled down with both of his hands in some
    gesture of rage. The front of his uniform was soiled with vomit. I really
    felt sorry for him but I did not know what to say. I was learning that army
    life was not going to be fun, and I learned one lesson I never forgot: when
    it's time to cleaning the grease traps while on KP, be sure you are busy
    doing something else. No matter how bad the job is you have, it is not
    nearly as bad as ladling out stinking sewerage from a grease trap.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I returned to my barracks that evening, where
    I had just enough time for a badly needed shower before lights out. I
    collapsed onto my bunk and fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.
    The next day it was up early for more instruction classes. Later, we had to
    scrub the barracks floor on our hands and knees. The floor had been scrubbed
    so many times it was bleached almost white. Then the noncoms took us out on
    the street, lined us up in rows, and tried to teach us a few basics about
    formations, saluting, and marching. We learned how to snap to attention on
    command, assume a sober looking face, and listen closely to the commands. As
    simple as it all was, it was comical to see how some men found it so
    difficult to follow basic instructions like stand in a straight line.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While at this location, I developed a
    toothache and got permission to go and see the camp's dentist. He told me I
    had two cavities and he proceeded to drill them out without giving me any
    Novocain. The pain was severe and I clutched the arms of the chair and
    muffled my moans as best I could. The dentist proceeded as if it was all in
    a day's work. When the drilling was completed, he filled the two teeth and
    announced he was through. Thinking that he meant he was through for the day,
    I asked him when I was to return. He replied, "Never." When I had
    a tooth filled in civilian life it took three or four visits to the dentist.
    I was learning the Army did everything different, including filling teeth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We did a lot of marching in formation around
    the camp, partially to give us exercise but also to familiarize us with
    basic military commands. We thought we were improving, but judging from the
    complaints of the buck sergeant (three stripes) who was drilling us, we
    weren't. Part of our day was spent in classroom instruction on various
    subjects, and we were shown several films about the Army. These films seemed
    to be an attempt to blend us into our new lifestyle but, as we learned
    later, they were more likely written by someone from Hollywood who had never
    worn a uniform. One of them was so old it well might have been left over
    from World War I. More inspections were made both in and out of the
    barracks. There was a lot of picking at our uniforms by the sergeants. Caps
    were adjusted to a certain angle, the bottom half of ties were moved to fit
    between two specific shirt buttons, belts were redone, and shoes were never
    polished enough. Basics like the hand salute were rehearsed over and over
    again with a sergeant going down each line of soldiers making adjustments to
    our arms position. While in formation, lines were straightened and men were
    told to stand up straight, tuck their chins in, look straight ahead, and
    keep their mouth closed. The sergeant would yell out, "You're catching
    flies!"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While we had heard induction centers like
    this made an effort to match up the civilian occupation or skills with
    matching jobs in the army, I saw no sign of this. From my perspective, they
    were taking all the men who came into camp and sending them out to places
    where they were needed to fill quotas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After a few more days, we were notified we
    were ready to ship out. My entire barracks and the men from several others
    were formed into ranks in the street. With our limited amount of gear in
    tow, we were marched for several blocks to a railroad depot at one end of
    the camp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At that period in history, the country was
    awash in streamlined trains introduced about ten years earlier. Many of them
    had exciting names like Zephyr, The Super Chief, Hiawatha, and El Capitan.
    They were usually advertised as being extra fine and extra fast. With their
    sleek engines, stainless steel passenger cars with brightly colored logos,
    large picture windows, and modern interiors, they were setting new standards
    for speed and luxury in rail transportation. They were air conditioned and
    often fitted with the newer diesel engines.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">But, the job of shipping soldiers, especially
    raw recruits, was delegated to an old steam engine and even older passenger
    cars. That's what was sitting on the tracks at the depot. The cars were
    painted black and with their riveted bodies resembling odd-shaped boilers
    and clerestory roofs, they definitely had the look of an earlier era.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We boarded the train as our names were
    checked off a roster. Inside was no improvement over the outside, and it was
    obvious they were not air-conditioned. The cars had been sitting out in the
    sun for a long time and were stifling hot. We all headed to the windows to
    get some fresh air; it took two men to open each one. The interior dark
    green cloth-covered seats that had seen better days, a well scuffed-up floor
    without a trace of carpeting, and walls painted a dirty yellow. It was
    nothing more than basic transportation. We were in what was known as day
    coach, or simply coach, with sitting accommodations for day and night use.
    One of the men in our group commented, "You've heard about first class
    and second class accommodations, well, welcome to last class."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Selecting a seat involved picking out someone
    we had made friends with just a few days before. We sat two abreast facing
    two other men. The train chugged out of camp, picking up speed as we headed
    west. I had never traveled farther than Joliet, Illinois, which was about
    thirty miles from my home, so at first the trip was quite exciting. In
    western Illinois, we passed through small towns that were visible only for a
    fleeting glance. The small wooden houses and the one-block long string of
    stores in their business districts were past before we could make out any
    discernible features. Some of the towns had a depot, and occasionally we
    caught a glimpse of someone waving, usually a child, as we rolled through at
    top speed. We heard the repetitive sound of bells clanging as we passed
    roadways with cars waiting for us to pass. We became so accustomed to the
    engine shrieking, whistle blowing, swaying movement of the cars, and steady
    clickity-clack of the wheels hitting the cracks in the rails we no longer
    noticed it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our interest in seeing the sights soon waned,
    and our attention turned back inside the train. There we picked up a
    one-on-one relationship with our new friend. Most of the conversation
    started with a question. "Where you from?" "Where's
    Manitowoc?" "Have you ever been to Chicago?" "Where do
    you think we're going?" It was reassuring to find the guy next to you
    sounded a lot like your civilian friends. With no history to share, however,
    much of our conversation was used up early. We went back to staring out the
    windows at the scenery, each man wrapped up in his own thoughts. The mood in
    the car ran from periods of merriment with someone telling jokes or acting
    up, to times of routine conversations, to moments of quiet reflection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Next came Iowa with its many farms and fewer
    towns. The scattered farmhouses with red barns, windmills, and silos all had
    a sameness about them. There were many animals, continuous fences, and acre
    after acre of crops that to a city kid like me, all looked alike. A constant
    sight was the miles of telephone wires and poles. One of the men on board
    said he knew how many feet the poles were spaced apart so, using the second
    hand on his watch, he tried to figure out how fast the train was going.
    Somehow, it didn't work out right, and he seemed embarrassed to have brought
    up the subject. We passed rivers both big and small. Crossing over bridges
    and trestles accentuated the train's noises, and always drew the men's
    attention to the windows to see what was going on. We stopped at the depot
    of a small town to pick up water for the engine. The few people about paid
    us no attention. America had been at war about a year and a half, and troop
    trains were as common as a freight train. A couple of young ladies walked
    along the platform causing most of the trains occupants to move to the one
    side of the car to get a better look. The men commented and the girls smiled
    graciously. Back on the move, Iowa's flat farmland was beginning to be
    boring.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we continued west, there was much debate
    as to what route we were taking. Were we in Missouri or Nebraska? Whichever
    it was, the landscape continued to be amazingly flat with open prairies that
    seemed to be used for nothing except occasional grazing land. Signs on local
    water tanks identifying the name of the town were unfamiliar to us and gave
    no help in determining where we were. Gone were the green crops of Illinois
    and Iowa. Then towns and farms became less frequent. The roadside gates with
    their clanging bells took on the added sight of flashing red lights when the
    sun went down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At night, we made every effort to find a
    comfortable position to sleep while sitting up. Men would twist their bodies
    into distorted positions trying to get comfortable. We took our shoes off
    and slept in our khaki uniforms. Unfortunately, I was not one of the first
    to fall asleep, and then it became a challenge to do so because of the loud
    snoring, heavy breathing and indescribable noises some men were making in
    their sleep. I had never heard anything like it in my life, not even during
    those nights in Camp Grant. Finally, I dozed off and after a restless night
    sleep, awakened to a beautiful sunrise over the plains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All of us had been assigned numbers for our
    trips to the diner, and we took turns eating by groups. The food was very
    good, and we kidded about getting the cooks who worked for the railroad to
    come with us into the Army. The waiters wore heavily starched white jackets
    and their ability to work efficiently despite the movement of the car amazed
    us. There was no time to laze around the diner and although it was not
    air-conditioned, the white linen tablecloths, uniformed waiters, and overall
    neatness greatly exceeded our coaches in style. We had to eat in a hurry and
    get out of there to make room for the next shift.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Without air conditioning, the train's windows
    were open during the entire trip to let in the outside air. They also let in
    smoke, cinders, and grime from the churning coal-burning steam engine that
    pulled the train, especially later when it would labor to make the steep
    grades in the mountains. We acquired a heavy layer of soot.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By the time we reached Denver, we began to
    feel relaxed with our new acquaintances and the trip began to take on the
    feeling of an adventure. There were all kinds of personalities. There was
    the funny guy with the jokes, the big talker, the one who boasted, the one
    who said nothing, the fellow who already had the Army all figured out, the
    one you knew would never be a friend, the guy who checked the picture of his
    wife in his wallet on a regular basis, and, mostly, just a bunch of men
    trying to be sociable. Some poker games broke out. One guy tried with no
    luck to get a crap game going by rattling dice in his hand. He looked like
    he was too eager to play, and he too closely resembled a con man from a
    cheap carnival. A fellow sitting across from me said, "Keep away from
    that guy," but never explained what he meant. I made some friends on
    the train with whom I would spend the rest of my time in the army.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had a long layover in the rail yards of
    Denver but, in what would become a familiar pattern, nobody offered an
    explanation why. Most of the time there was spent lounging around our
    railcar playing cards, reading, and talking. Being stuck in one confined
    location soon became monotonous. We were learning about that phase of
    military life that was always amplified because of our restricted movement.
    Finally, without any notice, the train lurched forward, and we were on our
    way again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Things became more scenic as we moved into
    the mountains of western Colorado. This was another first for me. We were
    also beginning to appreciate the variations of the different parts of the
    country and the magnitude of it all. After the Colorado mountains, we made
    our way through the desolate-looking states of Utah and Nevada before
    reaching California.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we reached the San Gabriel Mountains, we
    picked up a high-powered steam locomotive to pull the train up the Cajon run
    to the summit. The laboring engine gave us an extra dose of soot and cinders
    through the windows on the way. The train coasted down the mountains into
    San Bernardino and made the short run to our final destination. We had been
    on the train for almost sixty hours, and we were hot, tired, and extremely
    dirty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the time, we still had no idea where we
    were specifically or what branch of the Army we would be assigned to. There
    were many rumors floating throughout the rail cars, and, as we would learn
    many times in the future, they were all wrong.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a strong sense of anticipation and
    some nervousness among us as we sat there waiting to unload. We knew this
    new camp would determine the type of training, assignment, and even
    lifestyle we would experience for some time to come, if not for the duration
    of the war. Were we to be infantry and be immediately sent overseas as
    replacements for those killed in action? Would we be lucky and be assigned
    to the Army Air Corps where life would be a lot more pleasant? Was it some
    type of unit we knew nothing about but might be interesting and perhaps
    offer some kind of a challenge? These were the questions we discussed among
    ourselves as we waited to unload. Our future in the military was hanging on
    what we would learn in the next few hours.</font></p>
