<font face="Arial" size="3">In November 1944, we were finally notified we were
going to be shipped overseas. This was no surprise because we had been expecting
it for a long time, but it did raise a question. Why had our battalion been
chosen to stay together as an antiaircraft unit? Most of the other antiaircraft
battalions still remaining in Camp Haan were being disbanded with the soldiers
being sent to other camps for infantry training. We knew enough about the war to
conclude the Allied Air Forces had gaining air superiority over the enemy in
both Pacific and European Theaters of Operations. They did not need as many
antiaircraft units anymore. Men were needed in infantry units to replace the
high rate of casualties this branch of service had sustained. It was no secret
that branch of the service was dangerous. It was especially true at that phase
of the war, when ground forces were battling all over the globe. None of us
wanted to be assigned to an infantry outfit, and we felt extremely lucky to have
avoided it.</font>
</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3"><i>A total of two-hundred-fifty-eight antiaircraft
battalions were inactivated or disbanded between January 1, 1944 and May 8,
1945.<sup>1</sup></i></font>
</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">By the time we were ready to leave the States,
infantry casualties in the European Theater of Operations and to a lesser degree
in the Pacific Theater had greatly exceeded estimates, creating a crisis in
manpower. In the ETO, the invasion of Europe on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the bloody
fighting in Normandy, and the continuing battle for northern France all took
heavy tolls on the American foot soldier. Only the continuous feeding of
replacements, the very rapid conversion of GIs from Army and Air Force support
units, and students from the ASTP program bridged the gap. In many cases, the
results were tragic because many of these men were ill-grounded in infantry
tactics and became ready casualties themselves. Infantrymen constituted only
fourteen percent of American troops overseas, but they suffered seventy percent
of the casualties.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">We never officially got the answer why we were not
disbanded with the other antiaircraft units, but we were sure it had something
to do with the high scores we had achieved in gunnery practice. We learned that
our outfit was the Top Gun for the whole camp, or at least that's the way it
read on paper. The truth was, we were no better than any other battalion, but we
had bigger liars keeping score for us. No one from our outfit talked about it
much, but we were well aware of the deception going on. To outsiders, we kept
our mouths shut, as we became willing if superficial participants in the plan.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">After almost a year and a half of training, we
started to pack and get ready to leave Camp Haan. After our extensive training,
we were well-disciplined soldiers and appropriately proficient in performing as
an antiaircraft outfit. We knew this even though nobody in authority ever told
us so; it was something we knew within ourselves.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">I was put in charge of packing everything in
D-Battery for shipment. It would be nice to think I was given this assignment
because of my organizational or leadership qualities, but in fact I was given it
because I broke the number one rule in the Army: Never volunteer for anything.
When First Sergeant Ambrose asked if anyone knew how to type, I said I did and
realized immediately that I had volunteered for a job that required typing.
Acknowledging you had any kind of unique talent was synonymous with
volunteering. At least, in this case, the request by the sergeant for a typist
matched the final assignment. Usually, requests were used as a ruse to make a
fool out of someone.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, typing was only part of the packing job,
and overall I really enjoyed the assignment. It was a change in routine and
offered a challenge at a time when our training was getting very repetitive. I
set up a card table just outside the supply barracks, borrowed an old Underwood
typewriter, and preceded to organize the clothing, equipment, and armament we
would need. All metal parts had to be waterproofed with a thick layer of
Cosmoline the Army's version of grease. I had lists of items we were taking with
us, and I directed the packing in the many-sized wooden boxes. After the men
packed something up, I typed the proper forms and stenciled the box with the
number of our unit. Those that were going to be shipped with us were stenciled
with a big red T.A.T., which stood for To Accompany Troops. Typical of Army
bureaucracy, every box we crated needed a packing list with sixteen copies.
There were no copier machines in those days, so each invoice was typed five
times with carbon copies. Usually, the last copy of each set was so faint you
could not read it but most of the copies were never used anyway. Some of them
are probably still sitting in some government warehouse. Everything but the big
guns with their carriages and the trucks had to go into boxes. Whenever there
was some room in a box, I would add some of the men's sleeping bags. These were
the large ones we had purchased at the PX. The ones that the Army had issued
were too small to put blankets inside and were not nearly as good as the others.
The PX models were too big to fit into our duffel bags, the only other place we
were allowed to carry them. Some of the men wanted to smuggle beer and whiskey
in the packing boxes, but I told them they could not do it. However, because I
could not be there at the packing site at all times, I am quite sure there were
things stowed away I did not see.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">I had a hard time getting help for this assignment
because everyone was more interested in getting their final passes or furloughs
in the California area. I worked all day and most of the night trying to meet a
deadline. Things changed when word got out no one would leave the camp until
everything was crated. Then, I had dozens of men surrounding me at my typewriter
ready to go to work, and things were done in an expeditious manner.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">Each man's personal equipment and clothing were
inventoried to make sure he had all the proper items. We turned in the fatigue
uniforms we had worn most of the time in California. From that day on, the
uniform was to be the woolen OD uniform. The Eisenhower jacket went into the
bottom of the duffel bag because we wore it only when we were on passes, which
would become less frequent from then on. When the weather required it, we wore
our field jackets as an outer garment.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">We were missing some equipment for our unit, and
despite our written requests to the local ordinance department, it had not
arrived a few days before we were to ship out. Men were sent over to ordinance
at night to steal the equipment. This procedure was known in the Army as
midnight requisitioning. The thefts were made easier because our outfit was
furnishing the guards for the supplies.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">There were some sad farewells as we loaded up and
prepared to leave Camp Haan by train. Many of the married soldiers had brought
their wives out to California to stay near the camp, and there were many tears
shed as the women said farewell to their husbands. To the rest of us, it was
just the next step of our Army stint. There was no fear about what was to come
but no joy either in leaving the sunny land of southern California. We all had
enjoyed the wonderful weather and the many entertainment facilities. We started
out hating Camp Haan but had learned to appreciate it, at least in comparison to
many other camps we had heard about. Several months had passed since we had been
out to Camp Irwin in the desert and, evidently, we had forgotten what a
miserable place that was. It would not be missed.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">While we were preparing to leave, a friend of mine
named Dan (not his real name) from Battery C came to see me. Dan and I had been
friends in Chicago before the war and had gone into service on the same day. We
had gone through grammar school together, and he had been part of my
neighborhood gang at one time. However, our friendship had somewhat cooled while
in the service because Dan and I were opposites in just about everything we did.
When we first arrived in California, we had gone out on several passes together
where our differences were highlighted. We had not gone anywhere together since
that time, but I would see him frequently at the PX and other places in the camp
area and out in the desert.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">Dan came to tell me he was not going overseas with
our unit. I had noticed he was limping badly when he entered my hut. He said he
had injured his leg in an auto accident and the Army doctors had told him he was
not capable of overseas duty. I had the feeling Dan was faking this injury, but
I wondered how he could fool the doctors. Later, several men from his battery
who bunked in the same hut with him told me they were sure he was faking because
they had seen him at times when he did not have the limp. They also voiced their
displeasure with him in deserting their ranks just before we shipped out to go
overseas.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">I wondered at that time how much influence Dan's
father had in the matter because I remember him as being very pro-German. The
family was of German heritage, and, despite some effort to hide their political
views, they espoused the belief Roosevelt was getting us into a war with Germany
where we did not belong. Dan's father attended meetings of the German-American
Bund Party until the American Government outlawed it. He was quite upset when
Dan was inducted. While we did not know where we were going to be sent overseas,
the probability of it being to Europe was strong.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">Dan stayed in Camp Haan when we shipped out. Later,
he was sent to the Panama Canal Zone where he became a staff sergeant for the
duration of the war. I always felt there was more to that story, but I was never
able to find out what it was.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">On November 21, 1944, we boarded a train, pulled out
of Riverside, and took a six-day trip across the country to New York City. When
stopped along the way, the Red Cross showed up to serve us donuts and coffee.
The passenger cars we traveled in were made specially for hauling troops. They
were square in shape, painted gray and more closely resembled boxcars than
passenger cars. Inside they were functional with seats that folded into bunk
beds at night. Despite their lack of frills, the cars were comfortable and met
our basic needs.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">The closeness of many men in this confined area for
such a long period of time could have created some hostility, but the opposite
took place. For some reason, there was a feeling of good cheer, and for most of
the trip the atmosphere resembled a big party. There was a lot of acting up,
kidding, and telling jokes. If we had any apprehension about our going overseas,
it was certainly not visible.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">The train stopped at the La Salle Street Station in
downtown Chicago for about eight hours, but we could not get off, not even to
make phone calls. Only one person was able to contact anyone. His father was a
Chicago police sergeant, so he yelled his father's name out the window of the
train to one of the policemen standing on the platform. In about twenty minutes
the man's father showed up. Army MPs were stationed along the platform to assure
we did not get off or anyone got onto the train. The cop found the car where his
son was located and, as he headed toward the door, an MP tried to stop him but
he was no match for this burly streetwise cop. He brushed the young MP aside
like he was swatting a fly. As more MPs converged on the scene, they decided to
make this one exception because the situation also drew more policemen. A number
of us who got to meet the sergeant gave him our phone numbers in Chicago so he
could call our parents to tell them we were headed east. We could speculate
about where we were going, but the only thing we knew for sure was the direction
we were headed. After we left the station, the train headed south and then
turned east again. I knew we were passing my old neighborhood on the south side
of the city when I spotted the large, brightly illuminated sign of the Avalon
Theater. It brought back many fond memories of my days as a civilian because it
was only a few blocks from where I would hang out with my civilian buddies. Soon
after, the train passed less than a block from where my parents lived, but it
was raining hard at the time and I did not get a good look at my old
neighborhood.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived at Camp Shanks (See Fig. 61b), located near Orangeburg,
New York, about thirty miles up the Hudson River from New York City, to wait for
debarkation.<br>
</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<img border="0" alt="Camp Shanks" src ="images/Camp_Shanks_9_61b.jpg" width=700 height=552 >
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">The camp was known as a staging area for the Port of Embarkation
(POE). The change in temperature was hard to get used to because the weather
there was extremely cold. We had come from an extended stay in the warm
temperature of California into the cold winter weather of New York. The barracks
there offered the same sterile environment of all Army camps, but we had gotten
accustomed to this look by now.&nbsp; We had no idea where we were going yet, but
the Pacific Theater of Operations seemed to be ruled out. We were thankful for
that because stories coming back from there since the beginning of the war told
of the fanatical way Japanese soldiers were fighting and the rotten climate in
most of that area. Later, we would learn that conditions in the European Theater
of Operations would be different but not necessarily that much better.</font>
</p>
    <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="3">We received a new round of shots.</font>
