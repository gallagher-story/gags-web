    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We headed east into Germany to our next gun
    emplacement, a trip that took about eight hours.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after crossing the Luxembourg - German
    border, we saw Germany's Siegfried Line; the continuous line of bunkers and
    defensive fortifications that stretched as far as we could see. It was a
    sight to be remembered. There were pillboxes and bunkers with dome-shaped
    tops. The barrels of large guns were sticking out of them, all facing toward
    Luxemburg. We would later learn these structures were all connected together
    with underground tunnels. Between the pillboxes were multiple rows of
    pyramid-shaped slabs of concrete obstacles called dragons' teeth (See Fig.
    87a). They projected from the earth and extended in both directions
    perpendicular to our crossing site.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Siegfried Line" src ="images/Siegfried_Line_17_87.jpg" width=500 height=318 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The whole defensive system was much more
    impressive than anything we had seen in the newsreels. Its magnitude was
    awesome, and we were seeing only a small portion of it. The defenses seemed
    to be relatively intact even though there were multiple craters scattered
    about caused by either artillery shells or aerial bombs. We commented how
    ironic it was for the highly-aggressive Germans to build such an elaborate
    defensive fortress facing a tiny peace-loving country like Luxembourg.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the convoy made a temporary stop, Dillon
    exited the truck cabin and ran to the back to give us a message. He had seen
    a sign posted along the road that read, "You are entering enemy
    territory. Stay alert." We were not apprehensive about the German
    civilian population, but at the same time we knew there was a big difference
    in their attitude toward us.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>At this stage of the war, Hitler had
      mobilized a home guard under the command of Joseph Goebbels, his
      Propaganda Minister, to fight a rear guard action and to harass any troops
      occupying their cities.<sup>1</sup></i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later, while still in Germany, we heard
    rumors the Nazi government was setting up sabotage and resistance movement
    behind the allied army's lines. We saw no sign of this. The civilians we
    encountered seemed to be unhappy but resigned to their fate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our weapons gave us great confidence, but we
    knew it was not the same as traveling in Luxembourg or France, which were
    allied countries. We knew the people in this enemy territory were not glad
    to see us. Some towns had a number of white flags hanging from an upper
    story window to indicate surrender. Usually, they were not really flags but
    rather a substitute made from a white shirt or part of some bedding. Because
    they were still in place some time after the local battle had passed
    through, we took it to mean (right or wrong) that those who lived in those
    buildings had completely accepted all surrender terms. Usually, there were
    no other American troops of any magnitude to rely on if something happened,
    so we would have to handle any problem that arose. We hoped our supposition
    of complete capitulation by the civilian population was correct.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We soon saw many more towns heavily damaged
    by warfare. The destruction seemed much worse than anything we had seen in
    France (except for Le Havre) or Luxembourg. Again, we asked the question,
    "Where are all the people living, and how can those who are left exist
    in such ruins?" Some of the civilians we did see were carrying luggage
    or pulling little carts with their personal belongings on them. They were
    probably the only things they had left to salvage from their destroyed
    homes. While buildings could be rebuilt, other personal items were gone
    forever. A few of the wanderers had bicycles but they seemed to be using the
    bikes to carry supplies, not to ride. Everyone seemed to have the same
    troubled look on their faces, but here there was also desperation, or maybe
    defeat, in their appearance (See Fig. 87b).<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/German_City_destroyed_17_87b.jpg" width="700" height="473"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Germans wan looks were not entirely due
    to the destructive effects of warfare. Food was extremely hard to get and
    their meager diet was taking a toll on their health. In addition to those
    people who were moving along the rubble-strewn streets, others were digging
    among the destruction that had once been their houses. We asked ourselves,
    where would those carrying luggage go? One part of their town looks as bad
    as another and all the towns nearby were basically the same. There were no
    shops open-or to be more exact-intact, and we saw no open markets. How were
    they managing to stay alive? Why weren't they dying in the streets?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Moving through war-torn Germany was like observing a major catastrophe close
    up with the grieving and mourning survivors attending a prolonged funeral.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of
    England, said "Germany has been ground to powder." We observed
    that was only a slight exaggeration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The deplorable sight of destruction and
    misery was accentuated by the smell of death, sometimes mixed with the scent
    of strong antiseptic, but the smell of death always prevailed. It usually
    started as we entered a town, grew stronger in its center, and did not let
    up until we were some distance past the town limits. It often lingered in
    the truck long after we had passed into a rural area. We felt it had
    permeated our clothing and equipment made of fabric. The many dead who could
    be found had been buried, but there were many more in the ruins who could
    not be located and who never would be properly buried. We could avert our
    eyes to avoid the sight of death and destruction, but there was no way to
    avoid the smell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were areas along the road and sometimes
    right in the middle of a city or town where there would be two or more
    crosses. These were small makeshift cemeteries where the German civilians
    had buried their dead. There were also military graves, and they usually had
    a rifle instead of a cross sticking up from a temporary grave as a marker,
    sometimes, with a helmet sitting on top. They had been hurriedly dug as the
    German army was retreating. None of the graves were those of American
    soldiers because they had all been removed. This was enemy country and the
    people and scenery shouted with defeat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Even the people's clothing added something to
    the gloominess. There was a complete lack of any bright colors - everything
    appeared to be black, dark blue, dark gray, brown, or some other shadowy
    color. Weren't there any clothes made of yellow, orange, or red material
    left in Germany? Were the people dressing to mourn their downfall and the
    death all around them? Even the little bit of white we saw seemed to be more
    drab gray than pure white, including the surrender flags.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From the looks of the villages, it was
    obvious that they had come through some heavy bombing, strafing, or
    artillery fire, maybe all three. Some towns had been bombed, shelled while
    the Americans fought their way in, fought over house to house. Then the town
    was shelled again by the Germans as they tried to drive the Americans back
    out. There were totally destroyed buildings, partially destroyed ones, and
    some with their windows all blown out and walls heavily pockmarked from
    flying projectiles. Many buildings, even the walls of partially destroyed
    buildings, showed structural cracks, while others were scorched from fire
    damage. There were large piles of debris, some twenty or thirty feet tall,
    lying everywhere including in the streets. The only clear areas were the
    portions of the streets we were driving on, which had been cleared by Army
    bulldozers to allow our equipment to pass.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We drove through a park in one town where all
    the trees had been cut down by the civilians for firewood. Only the stumps
    were left as bleak reminders of what used to be, and these were now being
    chopped at for their remaining wood. There was a shortage of everything in
    Germany by this stage of the war, especially fuel for civilian furnaces. A
    corner of the park had been made into a cemetery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This scene of total destruction was repeated
    again and again in almost every town as we convoyed deeper into Germany. The
    war, and especially the Allied bombers, had taken the life and vitality out
    of this country. Homes, businesses, schools, churches, municipal buildings,
    and libraries were all in some stage of destruction-war played no favorites.
    What was left was a mass of rubble and the surviving civilian population in
    their piteous state.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We passed from one destroyed village to the
    next with the only variation being the size of the town. There were no
    sounds other than the rumbling of our convoy. All the noises usually found
    in urban areas were missing. There were no sounds of children at play,
    adults talking to one another, or autos honking-the only autos in sight were
    fully or partially destroyed. Adults moved along the heavily littered
    streets while the children tagged alongside, seeking some semblance of
    security in this insecure, chaotic atmosphere. Nobody, adult or child, could
    muster a smile, and some seemed disoriented. Their expressions showed
    sadness, hopelessness, fear, or blank looks that could be interpreted as
    meaning anything except an inner feeling of contentment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As bad as the present was, the future for
    these people looked even grimmer. Nothing was going to happen soon to change
    those melancholy and disheartened expressions. There was no stability, no
    system to support them, and they had nothing to look forward to. And what
    about food, water, heat, plumbing, and electricity? No distribution system
    or infrastructure could possibly still be in operation. There was no sign of
    relief-certainly not from a conquering army-just more of the same or maybe
    something worse. Were the air raids over?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Most buildings in the rural areas were
    damaged, although usually not as extensive as those in the villages. Even
    though we were part of the conquering army, there was no pleasure in
    victory. What we were seeing was depressing; not enjoyable. The only
    positive note was that we were on the winning team and when the war was
    over, we would be leaving all of this behind. Not only were the German
    people suffering badly now, but with such total destruction, it would take
    months and probably years to restore the basics of life and many, many years
    to get everything back to normal. The latter seemed an impossible task.
    Where would they start? Where would the money come from with their economic
    and financial institutions totally destroyed? Who would do the heavy work
    with so many German men not returning from the war? How would the people
    earn a living with all of their industry destroyed? Who would organize the
    reconstruction when most of their government leaders were killed or
    imprisoned? No wonder the people looked so lost. Germany was a vast
    wasteland in an unimaginable chaotic state.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We got tired of looking out of the truck
    because, after a while, it all started to look the same. But, even though
    the sights became tedious, they could not be easily forgotten. They would be
    with us forever. Soon we would be at the site for our next gun emplacement.
    There, we would have to exit our trucks and see some new village that looked
    just as bad as those we had just seen and people who were just as desperate.
    We told ourselves to get used to it, this was war, and there was nothing
    that we could do about it except add to the death and injury
    statistics-either theirs or ours.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We stopped at an intersection, and off to our
    left was a very large camp surrounded by a metal fence topped with barbed
    wire. The camp held thousands of DPs (displaced persons), or possibly they
    were slave laborers. They appeared to be all women. Most were gaunt and had
    a pale, sickly look about them. Every one of them had on the same
    baggy-looking gray uniform-their emaciated physique accentuated the
    bagginess-made of some coarse material and all in the same size. Hair
    styling and makeup were completely lacking. As they stood in one long line
    along the fence, some of the men in our convoy whistled and yelled at them.
    However, it was not with the same fervor, as they would have done with a
    beautiful or a healthy-looking girl. Stevens was one of those who whistled
    at the women from our truck and Bapst yelled over to him, "God! You're
    really hard up." Someone commented it was like flirting with your
    old-maid aunt although some of the women were not that old. They only looked
    that way from the tough life they had endured under German mastery. The
    women gave no response to the GIs. Even though they were recently liberated,
    they were staying in the camp so they could be fed. Here, too, there was not
    a smile in the bunch. Evidently, after what they had been through for many
    years, it would take a long time to recover. Also, like a lot of the German
    people, they were not counting the German army out just yet. It would not be
    the last camp like it we would see.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were going through one village where the
    streets were quite narrow, with the buildings close to the roadway. It was
    not just piles of rubble like many of the towns we had seen. It might be
    classified as being only heavily damaged. At a cross street, an MP stopped
    our truck. About ten large American tanks were coming down the street from
    our left. They were going to turn at the intersection and travel down the
    road we were on. The first tank made the turn but narrowly missed the houses
    on the corner that were mostly intact, although heavily pockmarked with the
    windows all blown out. The second tank did not do as well at making the turn
    as the first one did. It scraped the building on its left side, and some
    stucco and bricks came tumbling down. A woman opened a window-actually the
    sash without the glass-on the second floor of the damaged building, and
    began to scream at the tank commander. He had his head up and out of the
    turret, directing the driver, who was down below where there was limited
    visibility. The woman was shouting hysterically in German. The tank had
    already cleared the building when the commander got tired of being chastised
    by the enemy, even if it was a woman. I don't know how much German the
    commander understood, but we all knew the meaning of one word she was
    expounding: "dummkopf." He ordered the tank to stop. They reversed
    the direction in which they were traveling and swung the back of the tank
    around, punching it into the building. It made a gaping hole about three
    feet in diameter just below the balcony where the woman was standing. The
    balcony sagged slightly, and the woman ran back into the building,
    screaming. So much for German-American relations! As the following tanks
    passed the site, crewmembers of each would take turns popping their heads up
    and out of the turret to look at the hole in the wall. They would each laugh
    hysterically before going down again. There wasn't much humor in war so you
    had to make your own. Another tank scraped the corner of the same building.
    It looked like the driver was aiming for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we convoyed on, I tried to arrange some of
    the empty sand bags on top of the ammunition boxes in an attempt to make a
    bed and get some sleep. I was only partially successful, never making it
    quite comfortable. I dozed some but never fell into a deep sleep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The War Gets Closer</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We neared an area where the war was quite
    active, and as the adrenaline started to pump, we all came wide awake. There
    was no mistaking what was going on. There were many more troops to be seen,
    and the amount of equipment moving about was different from what we had seen
    earlier. Even the expressions on the faces of the GIs we saw were much more
    sober than anything we had seen. Soon we began to hear artillery fire. At
    first, it was like distant rolling thunder. Then it got louder and we could
    pick out individual volleys. We were headed toward the town of Alzey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we neared the town, we were on a very busy
    open road. The artillery fire was now quite loud, and we began to hear
    machine guns and occasional small arms fire. What in the world are we doing
    in this area? we thought. For some strange reason, most of us thought we
    would always be assigned to gun positions well back from where the ground
    action was taking place, as in our first two assignments. This was a new
    experience for all of us. We were about to get a taste of realism, and our
    excitement took on a new intensity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The most obvious sign we were getting near an
    active combat zone was numerous bodies lying about. Some were on the ground;
    others were in vehicles that had been pushed or maybe blown off the road.
    The dead appeared to be all Germans, but in some cases it was difficult to
    tell. Away from the road in an open field, three German women were walking
    along with shovels slung up over their shoulders like rifles. We assumed
    they were on a burial detail. There were many abandoned and mangled trucks,
    artillery pieces (See Figs. 88a and 88b), half-tracks, and tanks, both American and German. Even in
    their damaged condition it was easy to differentiate between the two because
    the Germans painted theirs in camouflage colors while the Americans used the
    solid OD. We thought about what had happened to the vehicles occupants but
    we did not dwell on the obvious conclusion very long. We saw several German
    88 artillery pieces with their dead crews lying about. The 88&nbsp; was considered to be the premium artillery piece of the German army and it
    was late in the war before the Allied armies came up with something to match
    it.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="German Artillery 88" src ="images/German_Artillery_88_Piece_17_88.jpg" width=550 height=331 ></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="German Artillery - World War II" src ="images/German_Artillery_Destroyed_17_88b.jpg" width=650 height=581 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the most startling things we saw as we
    moved slowly along the road was dead horses. Some were still harnessed to
    carts and several of them had been pulling artillery pieces. The allied
    bombers had destroyed most of the German fuel supplies at this stage of the
    war, and the Germans were reverting to the use of horses to get some of
    their armament and other supplies into position. We passed several mangled
    horses that must have taken a direct hit by a large shell of some kind.
    There was a dead German lying near them but his uniform covered most of his
    wounds and all we could see was several bloodstains. What irony war
    produced! Dead horses repulsed us, yet we did not think twice about a dead
    human being lying right next to them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The overall picture of death and destruction
    along both sides of the road was quite sobering. Seeing the carnage, even
    though the Germans were the enemy, added a feeling of repugnance to our
    other feelings. Nervousness replaced excitement. There was not a lot of talk
    among our crewmembers. I had not seen them that uptight since I had known
    them. Each man had his own thoughts about what we were seeing, and there was
    great apprehension about what we were getting into.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were the only antiaircraft unit on the
    road. Everyone else was what the Army calls Line Outfits: infantry, armor,
    and artillery units.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The road had two paved lanes, but with the
    shoulders of the roads being utilized there were four rows of traffic. Going
    into the village were two columns. We were riding in one line with some
    supply trucks on the pavement. On the shoulder next to us were tanks,
    armored personnel carriers, and a smattering of Jeeps. There were
    infantrymen hitching rides on the outsides of the tanks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Coming out of the village were two more
    lines. One line was composed of thousands of German prisoners of war (POWs)
    in a rag tag formation. Their uniforms were all of the Fielgrau (field
    gray-green) color and their steel helmets had been replaced with cloth caps.
    They looked extremely glum, and it was obvious they were newly captured.
    Some of them had been wounded and were wearing makeshift bandages. There
    were some very young and very old ones, but most of them were of the same
    age as members of our Army. Were these men really members of the same army
    that had conquered much of Europe with their blitzkrieg lightning war
    tactics? It was our first sighting of the Wehrmacht in any large number, and
    they were not very impressive looking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The other line coming out of the town
    consisted of GIs also moving along in a makeshift fashion. They looked like
    seasoned soldiers who had seen some real action. They were dirty,
    sober-faced, and weary looking. Most of them had light beards, something we
    had not seen up until then in the Third Army. There was none of the usual
    laughing and bantering back and forth usually seen when GIs were around.
    They wore blank stares that were the result of seeing too much action and
    too little sleep. Some just trudged along, and it was obvious they were near
    complete exhaustion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Watching the battle-weary men, I would
    occasionally feel a certain inner solace even though I tried to ignore it. I
    was glad it was them and not me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The only noise coming from the GIs was some
    yelling at the German prisoners who fell too far behind or got out of line.
    Then a flash of hatred would cover the nearest GIs faces and the command,
    "Close it up." would be accompanied with a string of profanities.
    We assumed the American soldiers were being rotated out of a combat zone.
    They had the job of escorting the captured Germans back to a staging area.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our truck stopped next to a German staff car
    that held two officers. Their faces still wore that overbearing look of a
    very high-ranking military officer. It was arrogance so tenacious it was
    being flaunted even when they were under a cloud of disgrace from being
    captured. We concluded they were staff officers, probably generals. But why
    were they still allowed to ride in their own car? A junior officer was
    sitting up in the open front of the car with the driver, who was a sergeant.
    It was the only vehicle of this type in the line of prisoners. There were
    also some trucks tightly packed with prisoners farther back in the line. The
    staff car was stopped, and it forced the other prisoners to make a detour
    around it. Then we noticed the car had a flat tire. The German lieutenant
    got out of the car, looked at the flat tire, and then he leaned into the car
    to talk to the generals. They said something to him, and he turned and said
    something to the GIs next to him who were yelling at everyone in the car to
    get out and walk. All of a sudden the GIs were cursing and swearing at the
    lieutenant. They knocked him to the ground and began pummeling him, then
    opened the back door of the car and pulled the generals out. As we pulled
    away, the generals were on the ground, being kicked. One of them was yelling
    at the top of his voice, "Stop it, stop it," in perfect English.
    An American captain whose Jeep was stuck in the line of traffic now stopped
    due to this incident jumped out of his vehicle and ran down the line to the
    altercation. One of our crew said he heard the German lieutenant ask the GIs
    to allow them enough time to change the tire but, evidently, the GIs were in
    no mood to make concessions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We could imagine how the GI guards felt. It
    must have been an emotional strain for them to see the enemy, regardless of
    their rank, riding along comfortably while they were walking. These GIs had
    just come off the front line, where they had been in a life-or-death
    confrontation with the Germans, and they had not lost their killer
    instincts. The high rank of the car's occupants probably had something to do
    with their forceful action. As we discussed among ourselves what had just
    happened, Bapst commented, "After all, how often do you get a chance to
    kick a general?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We entered the small town of Alzey on March
    22nd, and our gun crew was again assigned to dig in, in another park. This
    one was small and right in the middle of town, but off of the main road we
    had been on. It was probably two hundred feet square with residential
    buildings on all four sides and narrow streets at the corners. Other than
    our crewmembers, there wasn't another soldier or civilian in sight. Heavy
    bombardment to the north and east of town told us we were not too far from a
    major battle, although we did not hear any shooting in the town proper. It
    kept us on our toes every minute, and we were all quite tense.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Close Call&nbsp;</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was early afternoon when we arrived, and
    we were anxious to get the gun dug in as quickly as possible before sundown.
    While digging and filling sandbags, we kept our rifles just a few feet away.
    As we were finishing the pit in the late afternoon, some of us were making
    final adjustments to the sandbags. Armbruster and Spearing were near the
    front and I was working near one side when suddenly one of the bags gave a
    pop, and a hole appeared in it. The noise was not loud and I wasn't sure
    what had happened until I looked over at them and saw the look of shock on
    their faces. The bullet had passed right between them. The three of us dove
    over the sandbags into the partially constructed pit as we yelled for the
    others to take cover. We were all hunched down in the gun pit. The question
    was, what did we do now?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a three-story building to the north
    of us that was bigger than the adjacent buildings. We thought the shot had
    come from there. The machine gun crew was down in their newly dug pit also,
    and we debated raking the building with machine gun fire. No one suggested
    stalking the building. After all, we were not part of the infantry. At
    least, that was our reason for not doing something that did not appeal to
    us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Dillon was indecisive and seemed to be
    looking for someone to tell him what to do. If he thought anyone was going
    to volunteer to stalk that building, it wasn't going to happen. As long as
    he was uncommitted, we were content to wait it out, however long it took. We
    had not strung our telephone wire, so we had no communications with the
    other gun sections. Some armored troop carriers with men aboard moved
    through the square, but they did not stop. Even if they had, I doubt they
    would have been sympathetic to our predicament. After all, we had the same
    M-1 rifles they did, and, in fact, we also had the 40mm and four machine
    guns as backups.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After fifteen or twenty minutes, we got the
    break that solved our problem. Six two-and-a-half ton trucks along with a
    couple of Jeeps moved into the area and stopped in front of the three-story
    building. The men dismounted and began to reconnoiter that building and
    those on each side of it. Dillon and I got out of the pit and went over to
    talk with them. They were a headquarters staff for an infantry unit, and
    they were going to set up a command post there. We told them about being
    shot at. They already had troops in the three-story building, so the officer
    in charge yelled for them to look around for a sniper. They found none, so
    Dillon and I went back to join our crew and continued working on the
    preparation of our pit and equipment. Our scouts, who normally would be out
    stringing the telephone wire by this time, had found an excuse to stay close
    to the gun pit. They were both members of the M-51 machine gun mount and
    were working on one of the machine guns that had jammed. At least, that was
    what they said, and nobody volunteered to take over their job.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The background noise seemed to die down a
    little at dusk. We were manning our guns and scanning the sky for enemy
    planes. The logical direction to point the gun was north, where the Germans
    were more likely to come from. However, because of the three-story building
    and others in that direction, we could not see very much of the sky. If an
    enemy plane came from there, especially at a low altitude, we would not see
    it until it was right on top of us. We decided to point the gun to the south
    and possibly get some shots off on the down-leg run if they did come from
    the north.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Just before dark, we saw tracers going up
    from machine guns and swung our guns to the right at about the same time we
    picked up two ME-109s just over the roofs in that direction. They were on a
    north to south run, about a block away. It was not a good angle for us but
    we opened up just the same. We got off only a few rounds with the 40mm
    before the planes were out of sight. The planes had started strafing at
    about the time they were past the village, and it appeared they were aiming
    for the road on which we came into town. Days later, we found out there
    actually were three planes, but one was farther out and we never saw it. We
    also learned a gun crew in A Battery shot one of them down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">During periods of rapid and threatening
    advance by the Third Army, armored spearheads were continually attacked by
    low-flying aircraft, which attempted to blunt their thrusts. As rivers were
    reached, emphasis turned to attacks upon bridges and crowded roads leading
    to bridge areas.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Most frequently used evasive maneuver,
      when engaged by AAA, was to dive low and level off near the ground. In
      avoiding automatic weapons fire, violent turns were used or planes dropped
      to hedgehopping levels. Bursts of speed also were employed. Those enemy
      aircraft that tried to climb or make bank turns were often shot down,
      except where they climbed to cloud cover or directly into the sun.<sup>2</sup></i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">That night, the noise seemed to pick up
    again, and we could see flashes of light northeast of our position and hear
    low rumbling sounds of artillery. At first, the light and noise would appear
    in bursts but later they were on a constant basis. We kept more than the
    usual amount of men on guard duty. As I remember it, none of us slept at
    all. We had not even looked for a place to bed down, so we were all hanging
    around the gun pit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At about 0100 the next morning, another
    Midnight Charlie showed up. There were no searchlight units in the area, but
    we could again recognize it by the distinct sound of its engines. After
    seeing what had happened to the last Midnight Charlie, I figured this was as
    close to a suicide mission for the plane's crew as they could get. It was
    off to the side of our pit quite a bit at a high altitude that was probably
    out of range of our gun. We watched him go crawling by, and no one fired at
    him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The next morning Dillon, Grimes, and I walked
    over to the three-story building where the infantry had set up their CP. I
    don't remember the purpose in going there, but we stayed for about twenty
    minutes. When we came out of the building, there were two trailer trucks
    sitting in the street in front of the building. They were both packed with
    German prisoners of war. They were standing up, and they were so close to
    each other they could barely move. The GIs would hit the legs of the
    prisoners with the butts of their rifles while loading, packing them tightly
    into the truck. The truck drivers were standing up by the cabs, talking, as
    the three of us walked by near the rear of the trucks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">These prisoners looked ragged and dejected.
    They showed none of the insolence we had seen in pictures of German soldiers
    earlier in the war. Gone was the look of superiority they had radiated when
    their army rolled over most of Europe. They had spread terror throughout the
    countries they occupied, but now they were on the run. What a letdown this
    must have been for them because they were not used to losing battles. While
    the Germans still had some fight left, it must have been clear to them at
    this stage of the war they were in complete rout, and nothing but a miracle
    could save them. Their final defeat was inevitable. The long faces of the
    prisoners told more about the progress of the war than anything else we saw
    or heard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were several officers on board these
    trucks, and they were still wearing their side arms (pistols) on their
    belts. We thought they might be just the leather holsters, because that's
    all we could see. We yelled up to them to throw down their guns, but they
    tried to ignore us. One of them said something in German but the only thing
    we understood was Geneva Convention. Evidently, he was telling us he was
    protected from giving up his side arm by some part of the Geneva Convention.
    While we were no experts on the international agreement that established
    rules for the humane treatment of POWs, we knew the keeping of arms was not
    allowed under any circumstances. We were bent on getting the guns, and some
    law we knew little about was not going to stop us. Finally, Grimes pretended
    to cock his rifle and then raised it and pointed it at the head of one of
    the officers. Actually, all of us already had a round in the chambers of our
    rifles. Grimes released the safety on his rifle, which made a definitive
    click. The three officers at the rear of the truck took off their holsters
    and threw them down on the ground. Each of us picked one up. They did have
    guns in the holsters. Mine contained a 9mm Luger P.08 (See Fig. 89a), and the
    other two held pistols that were Walther P.38s. The guns came with clips but
    they held no ammunition. We could only speculate why these officers were
    allowed to keep their guns after</font><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="German Luger" vspace="5" src="images/German_Luger_17_89.jpg" width="400" align="right" height="312"><font face="Arial" size="3"> they had been captured. Pistols were at the
    top of the list of the items the GIs wanted as souvenirs and it did not seem
    logical that the troops who loaded the truck would not have taken them for
    themselves. It did not make good sense to have POWs wear weapons after they
    were captured, even unloaded ones. However, nothing is logical during
    wartime. I still have the gun today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later, trying to justify why these German
    prisoners still had their side arms, we settled on a possible explanation.
    The men who had loaded the POWs onto the truck were front line troops,
    probably infantry. They had been, and very likely would be in the near
    future, in direct contact with the enemy. By this stage of the war, we all
    knew that being captured while in possession of any piece of a German
    soldier's equipment or uniform was a sure way to get shot. This was also a
    common practice of GIs who executed German prisoners for possessing American
    equipment. Our theory had a few holes in it but it was the best we could
    come up with.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Glad To Leave Alzey</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It wasn't long after the three of us got back
    to the gun pit when one of our Jeeps showed up to tell us we were pulling
    out. We loaded up extra fast because we were anxious to get out of that
    town. It had only been a little over twenty-four hours since we arrived.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After forming a convoy around the park, we
    headed out of town going in the opposite direction on the same road we had
    come in on. It was still busy with traffic going in and out. Just outside of
    town, we saw the damage the ME-109s had done with their strafing the evening
    before. New carnage compounded the burned-out trucks, overturned guns, and
    bodies we had seen on the way into town. Right next to the road were bodies
    covered with GI blankets. Our convoy stopped for a few minutes and we talked
    to men from the Graves Registration outfit who were cleaning up a truck that
    had taken some direct hits. They told us a number of GIs had been killed and
    wounded by the strafing planes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Farther down the road, we made another stop.
    Next to the road there were about twenty GIs looking for land mines along an
    open area. Others were marking the cleared areas with white tape. Some men
    were sweeping the area with electric scanners while others were down on
    their knees, inching ahead as they probed the ground with their bayonets. In
    trying to stem the advancing Allied armies, the German army used mines
    extensively, especially when the war came to their homeland.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While we were stopped, Spearing started
    explaining the German mine called Bouncing Betty we had heard about.
    "If you activate it, it jumps up in the air and throws scrap metal all
    over the place," he commented. "Great, Spearing," I said
    sarcastically. "What an opportune time to mention that."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The slight delay seemed much longer than it
    really was. Finally the convoy started up and we moved beyond the danger
    area. "Do you suppose anybody ever volunteers for that job?" asked
    Stevens. "Only if they are looking to have their $10,000 life insurance
    policy paid out in a hurry," responded Armstrong. "Either that or
    they're nutty as a fruit cake." said Dillon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In just a few miles, we had seen two of the
    lousiest jobs in the Army: collecting bodies and looking for mines.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">About a week after we left Alzey, we got a
    copy of the Army newspaper, Stars and Stripes. It was published daily, but
    we saw one only about once every two weeks. This edition was about a week
    old and had a map on the front page, showing all the battle areas with the
    various Allied Armies designated. Evidently, at this stage of the war, they
    did not care if the Germans knew what armies they were up against. Then
    again, maybe they wanted them to know. The map showed arrows spearheading
    into Germany from many directions. At the tip of the arrow with the deepest
    penetration by the Third Army was the town of Alzey. One headline read,
    "Patton's Third Army drives deep into Germany."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While in convoy, we learned a soldier in
    another battery was killed when he fell off a M-51 mount while it was
    moving. Nobody knew any details, but it was quite sobering to all of us. We
    discussed how easy it was to be killed in an accident. We agreed if you were
    going to die in a war, it would be a lot better to be killed by the enemy so
    you would be remembered as a hero.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We passed through more towns that were badly
    damaged (See Fig 89b). The German civilians we saw ignored us as we passed. We saw another
    camp, but this time we were quite sure the inmates were slave labor. The
    entire area was surrounded by barbed wire and there were guard towers at the
    corners. The barracks were dilapidated buildings badly in need of
    maintenance. The inmates did not have uniforms like ay the last camp. They
    were dressed in what could best be described as rags and several men had no
    shoes. It appeared they were dressed in the same outfit they had been
    wearing when they were interred some years earlier. Several of our
    crewmembers waved at them but there was no response. Their gaunt faces
    remained silent and expressionless.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/German_City_Destroyed_17_89b.jpg" width="700" height="498"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In rural areas, we saw a lot of burned-out
    vehicles and many more makeshift graves along the sides of the road. The
    villages were mostly rubble. In one, the civilians were having a funeral
    with the small casket made from rough-cut lumber. "It's either a child
    in there or they used a shoehorn to get an adult in," commented
    Williams.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In Alzey we had had a little taste of being
    up close to the action. Now we were hoping our next stop would to be more
    like our earlier gun positions. Guarding some nice supply dump in the rear
    echelon would have been nice. However, it would not turn out that way.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>That night while we were in convoy, one
      of the most important operations of the war was shaping up just fifteen
      miles northeast of the location we had just left in Alzey. It would be the
      first crossing of the Rhine River by the Third Army. At 2200 hours on
      March 22, they crossed at the town of Nierstein. Shortly after the initial
      crossing a treadway bridge to handle vehicular traffic was built across
      the river just a few miles upstream at the town of Oppenheim. Some of the
      noise we had heard the night before was the American artillery softening
      up German positions on the other side of the river in preparation for this
      crossing.<sup>3</sup></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Planning for this crossing of the Rhine
      River had started much earlier when it became apparent the crossing might
      take place in the not too distant future. To prepare for the operation,
      the Army engineers established a special staff section to accumulate the
      men, equipment, and material that would be necessary for making the
      crossing at various sites. Assault boats, storm boats, outboard motors,
      life preservers, and bridging equipment were sent to supply depots, called
      dumps by the engineers, in the towns of Toul, Esch and Arlon. Materials
      would later be forwarded from these three sites to the advanced dumpsite
      at Alzey once it had been captured. This is why we were stationed in the
      Town of Alzey - to protect this dump, although nobody told us that at the
      time.<sup>4</sup></i></font></p>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="3">Although Nierstein would be the first
      crossing of the Rhine by the Third Army, several other crossings by
      American troops had taken place earlier. The First Army had established
      the first beachhead when they captured the Ludendorf Bridge at the town of
      Ramagen on March 7th. The Ninth Armored Division had captured it intact
      when the demolition charges set to destroy it failed to ignite.</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">Allied
      antiaircraft guns shot down sixteen German planes during this operation.<sup>5</sup></font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We enlisted men knew nothing of the Rhine
    River crossing. To us, this was just another phase of the war. Its grand
    significance was not realized until much later. The only thing we did know
    was, the Allied Armies-at least the small portion that we could see-were
    still advancing deeper into the heart of Germany. Were we deliberately kept
    uninformed for fear if we were captured, we could be forced to reveal
    information about the overall operation? Perhaps, but they never told us any
    details of what was going on while training in the States, in England or up
    until now in Europe. Why should anything be different now? We did what we
    were told and went where we were directed. Questions to our headquarters had
    been rebuffed so often we did not even ask them anymore. We were part of a
    dangerous and complicated operation that had no visible end. From our
    perspective, the battle for the Rhine was just one more milestone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Luftwaffe became more active as the
    Allied armies made an assault on the Rhine River. Following is information
    from the Third Army files regarding what happened at this first crossing at
    Nierstein:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>The Luftwaffe also ventured out in
      strength to strafe and bomb, but the air cover and antiaircraft prevented
      it from doing any more than incidental damage. For the initial days of the
      operation, air cover was constantly maintained over the bridges - during
      the day thirty planes were constantly in the air high over the bridge
      while four Battalions of antiaircraft, including multiple barreled .50
      cal., 40mm, and 90mm guns, were so effectively employed that even though a
      few German planes did sneak through the cover, the antiaircraft was so
      terrific that they were either shot down or driven (sic) off before any
      substantial could be inflicted.<sup>6</sup></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>As the battle for the Rhine River
      developed, the Luftwaffe began to pay more attention to the thrust of the
      Third Army, especially its armor. Just prior to this time, most of the
      German planes were doing reconnaissance over the entire front, primarily
      over forward elements. Then the full realization of the situation struck,
      and the Luftwaffe made an all-out effort to avert disaster. The rapid
      advance of the American army to the Rhine and points east resulted in some
      of the heaviest air attacks yet experienced. Due to the lack of their own
      ground resistance, the German air force attempted to stop the drive by
      attacking forward elements, particularly in the XII Corps.<sup>7</sup></i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The convoy moved on while we stripped apart
    K-rations to eat, drank well chlorinated water from our canteens to wash it
    down, talked little, thought a lot, hoped for the best and expected the
    worst.</font></p>
