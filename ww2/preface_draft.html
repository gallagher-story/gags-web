    Introduce his Story</a></b></font> <font face="Arial" size="2">(mp3 file
    recorded September 2006)</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This story takes you into the daily lives of
    an average GI during World War II. It begins shortly before America's
    entrance into the war when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7,
    1941. The author tells about his life on the South side of Chicago living in
    the shadow of the steel mills. He and his friends are enjoying their senior
    year in high school as the hard times of the Great Depression are coming to
    a close.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="images/Bob_Gallagher__smaller.jpg" alt="Bob Gallagher" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="256" height="418">America's entrance in the war changes
    everything.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After the disappointment of being rejected
    while trying to volunteer for the Air Force, the author is finally drafted
    into service. The story takes you through the induction center, the trip
    cross-country by train and finally his assignment to an antiaircraft
    battalion in a Southern California camp. Assigned to a 40mm gun crew, he is
    exposed to some high-ranking noncommissioned officers for training. He
    describes them as &quot;having the moral fiber of snakes.&quot; An eccentric
    captain adds much to the color throughout the story. The rigorous training
    includes several extended stays in the inhospitable Mojave Desert for
    gunnery practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Following training, he is shipped across the
    country to an embarkation camp near New York City. Crammed aboard a
    converted luxury liner headed for Europe, the ship encounters a major storm
    on the Atlantic Ocean that lasts for three days. Landing in Scotland, he is
    shipped to a camp in Southwest England that leaves a lot to be desired. His
    outfit loads aboard an LST (Landing Ship Tank) crossing the English Channel
    and landing on the beach in Le Havre France. From there they join General
    Patton's Third Army that is battling the Germans who are being pushed back
    through Northern France, Luxembourg and finally Germany. When the war in
    Europe is over he is shipped to Antwerp, Belgium where his battalion is made
    into an MP unit with its share of excitement. His concern for the
    possibility of being shipped to the Pacific Theatre is nullified when
    America drops the atomic bombs forcing the Japanese to surrender and the war
    ends.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The story describes the highs and lows the
    author experiences while coping with Army regimentation. He tells about his
    feelings toward the officers and noncoms that direct every move that he
    makes. It is a story about the human qualities of a GI at the bottom of the
    chain of command, along with his buddies, who are civilians at heart, and
    their struggle with the inefficiencies, inequities, frustrations, and
    downright miserable living conditions that military life can generate during
    wartime. The personalities and quirks of each of the author's fellow
    crewmembers with whom he lived are described in detail. Their actions and
    reactions to army life becomes more interesting to the reader because most
    of the crew can be identified through more than 180 photographs in the book,
    most of them taken by the author at key sites. Suspense, humor, compassion,
    excitement, and disappointment are all woven into the story.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The final chapter deals with life immediately
    following the war with the problems of adjusting back into civilian life. It
    tells about how some of the author's buddies did not fare too well and
    returned from combat with permanent disabilities.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="5">About the Author</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Robert F. Gallagher was born in Chicago in
    1924. He entered military service in June 1943 at the age of eighteen and
    was discharged in March 1946.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">His story is garnered from numerous photos he
    took during the war and from detailed notes he made shortly after it.
    Several reunions of his battalion in the early 1950s along with later
    contact with men in his outfit furnished additional information.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Following the war, he received his college
    education at the University of Illinois with the help of the
    government-sponsored plan known as the &quot;GI Bill of Rights.&quot; Soon
    after graduation, he married Lois Brumleve and they have been together for
    53 years. He spent his working years as a professional engineer (PE)
    primarily in designing and supervising the construction of infrastructure
    projects. As part of his duties, he frequently prepared a wide range of
    engineering reports for major construction projects. That training was of
    great help to him in compiling this book. When he retired in 1990, he was
    partner and executive vice president of a mid-size civil engineering
    company. He is the father of five married children and the grandfather of
    ten. He has lived in the same home in Flossmoor, Illinois, for 38 years.</font></p>
