    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">If there was a time in my life I
    would have liked to go on forever, it was the fall of 1941. Everything
    seemed to be going right for me, and I was enjoying every moment of it. The
    hard financial times of the Great Depression were over. School was about to
    end. I had discretionary money to spend for the first time in my life.
    Between enjoying the camaraderie of my buddies and dating the local girls,
    my social life was a blast. I was seventeen years old and I didn't have a
    care in the world.</font>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">What could possibly go wrong to change all
    that?</font></p>

    <p><img border="1" alt="Bob Gallagher and Friends 1942, Chicago, Illinois" src ="images/the_boys_1_1.jpg" width=614 height=541 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As a senior in high school, it was a matter
    of months before I would graduate. I looked forward with great anticipation
    to getting out. I had no plans to attend college. I would not miss school
    but I would miss the beautiful girls who adorned my classes. In a few
    months, we would write wonderful things about each other in our yearbooks
    with pledges to stay in touch, knowing that the friendships of the past four
    years were coming to an abrupt end. My future plans were uncertain, but at
    this point in my life I didn't really give it a lot of thought. The new and
    better life style I had been enjoyed lately as the result of money earned
    from an after school job blotted out much more serious considerations. The
    future was just that-something to think about later. The lean years of the
    1930s that had dampened my hopes of finding employment after graduation were
    now only bad memories as jobs were becoming easier to get. I was sure
    something good would work out for me in the country's growing economy
    without having the faintest idea of what it would be. Even the great
    political turmoil caused by the despots of the world that had our country's
    leaders and many adults gravely concerned did not offer me a clue to what
    was in my immediate future. Names like Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo were
    little more to me than cartoon-character depictions in the Chicago
    newspapers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I spent most of my spare time hanging out
    with my buddies on the south side of Chicago (See Fig. 1). We tried
    everything we could to have fun and create excitement in our lives. We gave
    up</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">some but not all of the really bad habits we had practiced during our
    early teen years. As we matured and took on new interests, some of the
    things that had thrilled us earlier now seemed to be quite juvenile, if not
    downright stupid. Gone were the days of hitching rides on the back of
    trucks, sneaking into movie theaters without paying, exploring empty
    warehouses along the railroad tracks, and other stunts better left untold.
    Those activities all had one thing in common: they could be done without
    spending money, a rare commodity in those days. The Chicago policemen who
    patrolled our neighborhood in squad car number 147 knew us by our first
    names, and all made trips to our homes to meet our parents, and not for
    social purposes. They chased us from some activities, suspected us of other
    deviltry, caught us at still others, and taken us down to the police station
    when they really wanted to give us a good scare. Scare us it did, but it did
    not down our mischievous pursuits. The father of one of our gang, named John
    "Zeke" Byrnes, was a lawyer, and he pulled us through several more
    serious scrapes that could have resulted in some permanent legal damage
    being done. It would take a comprehensive explanation of how the City of
    Chicago's Police Department and the court system worked in those days to
    explain. Suffice to say that neither agency was known for their high ethical
    standards and money-the kind paid under the table-and clout often
    substituted for justice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite the lectures, threats, house
    confinements, and other punishments we received, mainly from our parents, it
    was just plain growing up that changed our ways more than anything else.
    Also, the improvement in our financial status-we were all enjoying the
    fruits of our part time jobs-gave us a better perspective on things. It
    meant that we could afford things we had wanted for many years. Like all
    young men, we were crazy about cars and motorcycles, so a good portion of
    our money went toward the pursuit of transportation. This was where we found
    much of our new stimulation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My buddy, Frank Papie, bought a used 1937
    Harley-Davidson motorcycle and raced up and down 79th Street, the main
    commercial street in our neighborhood. He was showing us what great
    acceleration it had while Zeke was hanging on to him from behind on the
    buddy seat (See Fig. 2).<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Zeke and Frank Papie and Harley" vspace="8" src="images/Zeke_and_Papie_1_2%20.jpg" width="400" align="right" height="533"> The bike had a bad muffler so the roar of the
    engine sounded like an airplane with four engines revved up to full throttle
    during takeoff. Frank had mastered the art of keeping control of the bike
    when his tires crossed the streetcar tracks from having driven his previous
    motorcycle many times along the same route.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Hey Frank, what did you do with the
    Henderson?" I asked as he pulled up to the curb where the rest of us
    were hanging out in front of Miner - Dunn's Hamburger Shop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Still have it. Why? Do you want to
    drive it?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Do I want to drive it? Of course. Where
    is it?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"It's parked over on Cregier, next to
    Prendergast's Drug Store. Come on, jump on and I'll run you over
    there." Zeke got off the Harley and I got on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Henderson was the mother of all
    motorcycles (See Fig.3), and it was a monster by any comparison. Frank had
    bought it second hand about four years earlier. With its four-cylinder
    engine, it was bigger than most bikes and had only slightly less horsepower
    than some cars of the time. This one was twelve years old and had been
    driven hard and often over the years. It was sitting there propped up on its
    kickstand next to the curb, and its well-worn look told you that maintenance
    had not been a high priority for the many years it served its owners.
    Looping out from each side was a steel bar intended to absorb the shock if
    you tipped it over. They were called "sissy bars." The pavement
    under it had the usual pool of oil from the leaking transmission. The
    leather seat was peeling, there were several dents in the fenders and the
    tires were as bald as a billiard ball. But to me, a young man in his teens,
    it represented speed, power and the<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Henderson Motorcycle" vspace="8" src="images/henderson_motorcycle_1_3.jpg" width="400" align="left" height="276"> opportunity for adventure. Appearances
    were not even a consideration. I straddled the seat and pulled it upright
    from its tilted position-no easy maneuver because of its weight. Many times
    in the past, I had helped Frank, straining to bring it upright after it had
    fallen over on its side. It was a two-man job and, even then, it took great
    effort to stand it upright.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Keep your legs spread out or you'll get
    a shock that you won't forget from the spark plugs on those cylinders. You
    could lose control," he reminded me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Are you worried about me or the
    bike?" I asked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"You didn't cost me fifty bucks."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After five or six kicks of the starter
    peddle, the machine roared to life. I felt the surge of energy throughout my
    body. It wasn't as noisy as the Harley, but it made enough racket to let you
    know there were plenty of horses inside. As I worked the throttle back and
    forth, everyone within hearing range turned to see what was going on. Many
    times, previously, I had ridden on the back of the double seat with Frank
    and watched how to clutch, shift gears, and use the brakes, but I had never
    driven it by myself before that day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Frank began listing the bike's other
    deficiencies. "Don't rely on those hand brakes. They're not worth a
    damn. Use the foot brake mainly. Also, the spring on the clutch is too
    tight, so ease it back slowly or it can get away from you."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I thought, Let's see now; all I have to worry
    about is tipping over, getting a shock, the hand brakes, and the clutch. It
    would have taken more than these problems to scare me off. I remembered the
    thrill of riding as a passenger on this baby many times before, and I wasn't
    about to pass up the opportunity to make my solo run.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I pushed in the clutch, noting the effort it
    took, shifted into first gear, and labored to let the clutch out slowly as I
    gently twisted the handle for more power. "Come on, follow me, "
    Frank yelled as he took off, made a turn at the corner, and headed east down
    79th Street with an ear-shattering roar. He then slowed and tried to hold
    back to let me catch up. I rode in first gear up to the corner where I had
    to slow almost to a stop to let traffic pass. Finally it cleared and I took
    off after him, shifting into second gear. When I let out the clutch and gave
    the gas handle a good twist, I felt like I was being shot out of a cannon.
    What a thrill! The noise from the two bikes reverberated off the store
    windows on both sides of the street. It was loud enough to raise the dead.
    Then the Henderson backfired; it sounded like an explosion going off. It
    startled an elderly lady who was walking along on the sidewalk. She gave me
    a dirty look; mouthing something I couldn't hear. She was probably saying,
    "You hoodlum!" or maybe something worse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we continued on down the street, I
    concentrated on watching out for cars, pedestrians, and the big red electric
    streetcars that rumbled down the main street of our neighborhood (See Fig.
    4a). The streetcars were the primary mode of transportation in Chicago and
    they could take you anywhere in the city, with a transfer or two. Officially
    they were named the Chicago Surface Lines. 79th Street was made out of
    paving blocks that had been polished smooth by decades of heavy traffic. I
    rode between the tracks to avoid the rail slots, but I knew that any sharp
    turn on the bricks would send me into a spin. Despite all of the warnings
    Frank had given me, it was the bald tires on a slick surface that worried me
    most. We stopped behind a streetcar to allow passengers off. My feet
    immediately went down to the pavement to assure the bike did not tip, even a
    little bit. I glanced over to see several young boys on the sidewalk
    watching the two of us with what I interpreted as looks of envy.</font></p>
    <p><img border="1" alt="79th and Halsted Streets, Chicago, Illinois" src ="images/79th_and_Halsted_streets_1_4.jpg" width=650 height=555 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">That's right, fellows, now you know how I
    felt all of those times, I thought. Give the throttle a little punch so they
    can feel the power. Now, just don't grind the gears taking off and
    everything will be just fine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"That damn clutch is going to drive me
    nuts."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As the streetcar started up, Frank moved
    toward the curb as he glanced back at me and shouted, "Let's go
    around!"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Passing a moving fifty-foot-long streetcar on
    the right side had all the excitement and danger of playing Russian
    roulette. If a car was parked up ahead in the right lane, you might misjudge
    the distance it took to pass before you could pull back ahead of the
    accelerating streetcar. Despite their enormous size, they had a deceiving
    rate of pickup. Also, if a car pulled out too far from a side street while
    you were passing, you were dead meat. I'd had too many close calls along
    those lines as passenger to know I was not ready for that adventure on my
    own, so I yelled back, "No!" and just to make sure he heard me, I
    repeated it as we took off again with a roar. With no helmet or goggles, I
    was getting the full brunt of the elements as we picked up speed. In
    addition to the things you have to watch out for while riding a bike, I was
    trying to remember all of the unique characteristic of the Henderson I had
    been warned about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Oh, no, Frank's turning down Jeffrey
    Boulevard, I thought. It wasn't named a boulevard for nothing; traffic would
    be heavy and moving fast. While I was catching on to the art of shifting
    gears, I was still tentative about the idea of going too fast on a busy
    street when my steering control left a lot to be desired. There, I made the
    turn all right. Now just keep up with the traffic and everything will be
    just fine. Frank passed a couple of cars, and I followed him. We turned
    again at 77th Street at a speed faster than I would have liked. I felt the
    tires slip slightly as I dropped my left foot off the bike and held it just
    inches off the pavement in anticipation of tipping over. I was sure that I
    was going down, but somehow I recovered. To steady the bike, I had
    overcorrected the steering and I came within inches of hitting a parked car.
    I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. While returning my foot to the
    bike, my leg came too close to the sparkplugs atop the cylinders and I got a
    good shock to my right leg, just as I had been warned. The pain ran up my
    leg as I jerked it away from the cylinders. But, there was no time to dwell
    on my distress because too much was going on that needed my undivided
    attention. We raced across side streets without slowing down, with the
    confidence that any traffic would stop, not us. At the speed we were going,
    with cars parked on both sides of the street restricting our lateral sight,
    and the bad brakes on my bike, anything that got in our way would have meant
    a disastrous accident. But we made it back to where we had started.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I sat on the bike for a few minutes with my
    feet on the ground, savoring the experience. Future rides became easier, as
    I mastered the art of driving faster than necessary so adrenaline would keep
    pumping at all times. Riding a bike was no fun unless you were pushing the
    limits to where it was more than a matter of getting from one place to
    another. There had to be thrills involved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"It's the next best thing to sex,
    right?" Frank asked as we were setting the bikes up on their
    kickstands, following that first ride.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Right." I responded with the same
    bravado. Because neither of us had any first-hand experience with sex, we
    both knew the other was lying through his teeth. Both of us had attended the
    same Catholic grammar school and were well aware of the mortal sins
    resulting from such activities. At least, that's what we told ourselves to
    justify why we were inexperienced in that field of action. The real reason
    we had both kept chaste was the only girls we knew had also been well
    indoctrinated with the fear of losing their immortal souls and kept us at
    arm's length. We immediately dropped the subject because it was something
    that neither of us wanted to pursue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"I'm selling the Henderson," Frank
    announced as we headed into Prendergast's for a draft root beer, "but
    you can drive it until then. You'll have to put gas in it, though. I put in
    a nickel's worth a couple of days ago and then drained a couple of the
    hoses, so it probably amounted to half a gallon. There probably isn't that
    much left." Later, I drove the bike over to the discount gas station on
    South Chicago Avenue and put in one gallon. It cost me twelve cents and I
    knew that at forty miles per gallon, it would last me for about a week of
    neighborhood driving. It was now necessary that I adjust to the bike's many
    quirks that Frank had stipulated and to some he had forgotten to mention.
    Driving home on the evening of that solo run and finding that none of the
    lights worked was an important new deficiency to add to the growing list.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the next several months, I became quite
    proficient at driving a motorcycle and I had the time of my life doing it. I
    could even keep up with the Harley most of the time, but I still stayed away
    from passing a streetcar on 79th Street. Up to that point in my life, it was
    the most fun I had ever had.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Fall came and the weather turned cold and
    rainy. Frank sold the Henderson and my biking days were limited to riding as
    a passenger on the Harley</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>War Comes to the United States</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The weather on December 7th, 1941, was a
    pleasant change. The sun was out and it was quite warm for that time of the
    year. It started out like most other Sundays with a trip to twelve o'clock mass
    at Our Lady of Peace Church (See Fig. 4b).</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Our Lady of Peace Church, Chicago, Illinois" src="images/Our_Lady_of_Peace_Chicago_1_4b.jpg" ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After mass we walked across the street to Shapiro's Drug Store for a hand-mixed coke with a dash of cherry juice.
    When I walked
    through the door, there was a man standing by the cigar counter, and he was
    talking loudly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Those damn Japs, those damn Japs."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I moved over to take a seat at the soda
    fountain, not getting the significance of the man's ranting when I finally
    observed the obvious tension and serious demeanor of everyone in the place.
    Noticing my puzzled look, someone finally said, "Japanese planes have
    bombed our Navy at Pearl Harbor." While I had no idea where Pearl
    Harbor was located, I pretended that I did. "I'll have a cherry
    coke," I told the soda jerk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Nobody at the counter knew what to say at
    first as we sat there mulling over what we had just heard. Finally, anger
    began to replace shock when the first mention of hundreds of casualties was
    announced. As I left the drugstore, I met the parents of one of my friends
    and we exchanged greetings by shaking our heads with an indication of
    disgust and saying, "Isn't it terrible."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Walking home, I thought about what I had
    heard earlier. Well, the Army and Navy are going to have to do something
    about that situation. It never even occurred to me that I was going to be
    involved. While I had just heard news of what was to be one of the most
    significant stories of the century, by the time I was halfway home my mind
    was on something else. I was trying to remember what time the gang was going
    to meet later that afternoon to go to 75th Street for the triple feature at
    the Ray Movie Theater. That's what was important to me at the moment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later that evening at home, the inevitable
    consequences of the Japanese attack began to register for the first time.
    Our family turned on the radio and heard news commentator H. V. Kaltenborn
    give statistics on the loss of ships in our Pacific Fleet and the many
    thousands of casualties resulting from the sneak assault (See Figs. 5 &amp;
    6). The next day President Franklin D. Roosevelt made his famous speech to a
    joint session of Congress in which he declared the "day which will live
    in infamy."</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Pearl Harbor, West Virginia burns" src ="images/Virginia_burns_1_5.jpg" width=650 height=469 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after the speech, Congress declared war
    on the Empire of Japan. Nazi Germany, also known as the Third Reich, and
    Italy declared war on the United States on December 11th because of treaties
    these countries had with Japan. Everyone knew our country was now in for a
    long and bitter battle. Even then, it took several weeks before I fully
    realized how the events taking place would drastically change my life and
    the lives of everyone I knew.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Pearl Harbor, Arizona burns" src ="images/Arizona_burns_1_6.jpg" width=650 height=511 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In a very short period of time, we learned
    the total horrors of Pearl Harbor including the deaths of 2,323 American
    servicemen.<sup>1</sup> A sizeable number of battleships, cruisers and destroyers were
    sunk or badly damaged; hundreds of our aircraft were destroyed. It became
    abundantly clear to all Americans there was now a great justification for
    our entry into this war. Gone were the doubts. The isolationists could not
    defend their views when there was the possibility we were now defending our
    own shores. Families began to brace for the hardships war brings even to
    civilians outside the war zone. Tough sacrifices would soon be made as they
    committed the lives of their sons and daughters to military service in what
    the politicians liked to call the fight for righteousness over tyranny.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many factors led up to our country's entry
    into the war, and although a single act caused the declaration of war, the
    decision had been inevitable. The Germans and, to a lesser degree the
    Italians, had been pursuing policies of aggressively conquering neutral
    countries in Europe and Africa while Japan was doing the same in the Far
    East for a number of years prior to the Pearl Harbor attack.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">England and France had been at war with
    Germany since September 1, 1939, when the German army invaded Poland.<sup>2</sup>
    Earlier, Germany had annexed Austria and taken over the Sudetenland of
    Czechoslovakia. Two weeks after the German invasion of Poland, Russia
    invaded that country from the east after signing a non-aggression pact with
    Germany.<sup>3</sup> At that time, many Americans looked upon Russia as a greater
    menace to peace than Germany and the term "communist threat" was
    widely used in this country. Germany went on to conquer Denmark, Norway,
    Luxembourg, the lowlands of Holland and Belgium, and the north of France.
    They drove the British Expeditionary force out of continental Europe; they
    then occupied the greater part of Western Europe. During most of 1940 and
    continuing into 1941, Germany attempted to bomb Great Britain into
    submission with constant air raids on London and other parts of that
    country. At the same time, Germany and Italy invaded the Baltic countries
    and areas of North Africa. Despite these major incursions, many Americans
    still felt this was a European war, and they were comfortable with the ocean
    between what was happening over there and our country. They were convinced
    somehow the distance between would insulate America. Organized groups like
    America First openly and vocally preached a policy of isolationism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While this was going on in Europe and North
    Africa, Imperial Japan was invading and occupying with brutish behavior
    neutral countries in the Far East. Warlords who believed in taking over
    countries by force were dictating their country's policy. In July of 1941,
    the American government froze all Japanese assets in the United States in
    response to Japan's occupation of foreign territories. This cut off all
    trade between the two countries.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite our country's rhetoric of being
    neutral during those years of political turmoil and open conflicts on
    several continents before Pearl Harbor, America was not following a policy
    of completely isolation. We sent England military supplies, and our naval
    forces convoyed both British and American ships across the Atlantic
    sea-lanes. Congress had passed a bill called Lend-Lease in March of 1941
    that further allowed war materials to be shipped across the Atlantic. The
    world was moving from one crisis to the next. Still, the American people
    were heavily divided on what we should do about it. The prevailing feeling
    was that we should stay out of war. The bombing of Pearl Harbor on December
    7th finally awakened the American people to what was happening throughout
    the world. That single act on one day did more to unite the country than all
    the rhetoric or propaganda could ever have done. We knew then that we could
    not be neutral any longer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After December 7th, the major countries of
    the world split into opposing camps to fight a truly world wide war.
    Germany, Italy, and Japan were known as the Axis Powers. Despite the earlier
    pact between the two countries, Germany attacked Russia in June, 1941. As a
    result, Russia became our ally. Of the many countries opposing the Axis
    Powers, the United States, Russia and Britain were the major players and
    became known as the Allied Powers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Even though there was great emphasis put on
    the war, my friends and I continued to lead our lives as though nothing had
    changed. Most of our time was spent going to the movies and enjoying
    ourselves while hanging out at Miner-Dunn's hamburger shop at the corner of
    79th Street and Ridgeland Avenue (See Fig.7).</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/miner_dunn_1_7.jpg" width="697" height="275"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had progressed from the
    days when six of us would crowd into a booth and share a nickel order of
    French-fries to where we each had a hamburger, an order of fries and a
    Double Cola-total cost twenty cents. It seemed strange to be paying our way
    into the theaters because we had been sneaking in without paying for most of
    the years of the Great Depression. It was a hard habit to break. On weekends
    we always made a trip to Cooney's, a cheap saloon where they did not look
    too closely at our fake ID cards. Some of us were dating girls from the
    neighborhood. Because gas rationing limited the use of the family car, dates
    usually consisted of doing the same things we did during the week: movies at
    the local Avalon Theater (See Fig. 8), a stop at Miner-Dunn afterwards, and
    walking the girl home. We played sixteen-inch slow-pitch softball, handball,
    or touch football over at the Horace Mann-pronounced "horse man"
    by the locals-school playground when the weather allowed. We played a lot of
    pocket billiards and bowled at Turner's Bowling Alleys on South Chicago
    Avenue. But, most of the time, when we were not in school or working, we
    just hung around street corners lagging pennies or sat in Miner-Dunn's
    talking.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Avalon Theatre, Chicago" src ="images/Avalon_theatre_1_8.jpg" width=698 height=320 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Now that we had discretionary funds, I was designated by my gang as
    the "bag man" to place bets with the bookie located in a cigar
    store directly across 79th Street from Miner-Dunn. While the term "bag
    man" really indicted the middleman who takes bets for a crooked
    official, in my case it had a different meaning. It meant I was the one who
    collected nickels and dimes from my friends and went across the street to
    bet fifty cents on some nag to place after we diligently studied the
    racetrack lineup in the morning paper we borrowed, used, and then returned
    from the local newsstand. Because I was the tallest of our group, we felt
    the bookie would believe I was old enough to make a bet. In reality, there
    was no minimum age. The whole operation was illegal and the bookie did not
    care how old you were as long as you had the cash. We seldom won, but it did
    not deter us. It was the challenge that counted. We considered ourselves as
    near racetrack handicappers while in fact, we knew nothing about picking
    horses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Earlier in my senior year, I had a part time job at the Federal
    Reserve Bank in downtown Chicago, where my friends and I sorted checks for
    forty cents an hour pay. Here, too, we found a way to ride the edge of
    propriety when we used the men's washroom to gamble and run a sting,
    although a minor one. In this bastion of financial domination we would match
    pennies during our ten-minute breaks every hour. The sting came in when we
    rigged the outcome to win every time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later in my senior year, that same
    bunch of friends and I switched over to work at the Montgomery Ward
    warehouse located on Chicago Avenue, just west of downtown Chicago. We
    filled orders for their mail order business. Frank had sold the Harley, so
    the only transportation we had, other than the big red streetcars that
    crisscrossed the city, was an eleven-year-old Model A Ford coupe (See Fig.
    9). My friend Zeke had paid fifteen dollars for it at a junkyard. The car
    had no title, no front bumper, only one headlight, no taillights, no floor
    mats, no speedometer, and many other shortcomings.<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="1930 Model A Ford Coupe" vspace="8" src="images/model_a_ford_1_9.jpg" width="450" align="right" height="293"> We chipped in for gas we
    bought for ten or twelve cents per gallon. It burned a lot of oil, so we
    used drain oil we got free from the waste drums behind gas stations. We
    carried a crank to get it started because the battery was usually not strong
    enough to turn the engine over. Many hours were spent resetting the timing,
    cleaning the spark plugs (the waste oil we used did not help here), adding
    air to leaking tires with a hand pump, and measuring the gas with a stick
    because the gas-gauge did not work. The brakes were so bad the pedal would
    bang against the metal floor of the cab when it was slammed down in a
    desperate effort to bring the car to an emergency stop. Many stops were
    emergencies because of Zeke's reckless driving. To aid in stopping, he would
    shift down to a lower gear and finally into reverse, when needed, in a final
    desperate move. Often, eight of us would pile into this car that was meant
    to hold four people-two in the cab and two in the rumble seat-for the trip
    down the Outer Drive, along Michigan Avenue and then through the Loop to
    Montgomery Ward. Two of the eight people would be standing on the rear
    bumper and leaning into the rumble seat during the trip. People in other
    cars, mainly women, would gasp as we passed them on the road. The best
    description of that car came from a truck driver who leaned out of his cab
    while we were stopped next to him at a stoplight and yelled over to us,
    "Was anyone killed in the wreck?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Zeke, who was touchy about his car, responded
    with, "Jerk!" Despite its dilapidated condition, we had a lot of
    fun with that car, and for several years, it served us well as a means of
    getting around the city. In addition, it was the center of our social life
    and gave us great mobility. The police gave Zeke numerous tickets for
    speeding, erratic driving, four people in the front seat, missing headlight
    and the other deficiencies. One evening we were stopped for making an
    illegal left hand turn at the corner of Randolph and Michigan Avenue in
    downtown Chicago. Zeke was issued six citations. He tore up the tickets
    before the police were out of sight. Because the car had no title and the
    lone license plate had been picked up out of a gutter, tracing the owner
    would be impossible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Starting in the Spring of 1942, my friends
    and I started to pay more attention to the war when many of the young men in
    our neighborhood just a few years older than we entered into military
    service in large numbers. By that time, the newspapers, radio, movies, and
    conversations in general were full of things related to the war. It was
    common to see men in uniform everywhere we went.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of my friend's brother, Bob Walker, was
    accepted in the Navy's pilot program. He was commissioned a lieutenant in
    the Marines and came home on leave to describe how he was landing planes on
    aircraft carriers. He had been selected to fly one of the torpedo-carrying
    planes called the "Avenger." (See Fig. 10) We thought, what could
    be more exciting! Then he got his gold wings, and one day we saw him in his
    dress whites uniform. We would have given anything to trade places with him;
    first for the thrill of being a Marine pilot, and second for the way that
    uniform would change our social lives. Ed Prendergast commented, "If I
    had that outfit, I would have to carry a baseball bat with me at all times
    to fend off the babes."</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Avenger TBF / TBM" src ="images/Avenger_1_10.jpg" width=520 height=370 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While we knew there was some danger to flying a
    plane in combat, somehow we felt that the Marine pilot would be above it
    all. How wrong we were. Bob Walker was killed in action before I went into
    service. They never found his body because he crashed into the sea. That
    made the grieve process even worse for the family. He would be one of the
    first, but definitely not the last, of the many war casualties from the
    neighborhood. We heard words at his memorial service like
    "patriot" and "hero's death" for the first time. Until
    then, a hero had been some abstract person in a history book or possibly in
    the media. Heroes were now from closer to home and definitely becoming more
    personal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Once we realized we were not going to be just casual observers of
    the war, my friends and I began to talk a lot about what branch of the
    service we wanted to be in. In my case, there was no question about it. From
    the time I was a very young boy, there was only one thing in the world I
    wanted to do. I wanted to be a pilot. Since my early teens, I had been
    trying to learn everything I could about airplanes. I had large scrapbooks
    full of pictures of them that I had cut out of periodicals. On my birthdays,
    I would get a new subscription to Flying Magazine, and I would read each
    edition from cover to cover. I would also build model airplanes. When I was
    old enough, I would take the streetcar over to Municipal Airport (later
    named Midway Airport after a decisive naval victory in World War II) at 63rd
    Street and Cicero Avenue. I would stand at the fence and watch the planes
    land and take off for hours. From studying the periodicals, I could identify
    by sight any plane there was, including foreign ones. I looked on the war
    not as a terrible time when I would have to go into service and fight for my
    country with the chance of being killed or wounded, but as an opportunity to
    learn how to fly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In my mind, I had my role all planned out. I was one of
    the few people in the country who felt some good could come out of the war.
    It would be my opportunity to fulfill my dream, a dream that would
    eventually become an obsession. I thought only of myself and had no
    understanding of what war was really like. I still thought of it as an
    adventure that would make a hero out of me by quick and easy action. My
    friend Zeke wanted to be a Marine, and we figured it would be a good match.
    He was one of those rare individuals who was absolutely fearless and he
    loved adventure: The more challenging the better. But, just two weeks before
    we all were to graduate from high school, something happened that destroyed
    Zeke's dream.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the late spring of 1942, Zeke had traded
    in the Model A Ford for a four-year-old car called a Hudson-Terraplane. This
    car was a big improvement over the Model A but it did have two major
    deficiencies: it was top heavy and there was play in the steering wheel. The
    play was one of the things Zeke had on his list to get fixed as soon as he
    had enough money saved. While five of us were out driving about, or
    "bombing about" as we called it, we had an accident and Zeke was
    killed. He had let someone drive who was unfamiliar with the play in the
    steering and despite his coaching as to how to handle it, she-a girlfriend
    of one of our gang-rolled the car over on Zeke who had been standing out on
    the running board. Several of the others in the car, including myself, were
    banged up but we recovered without any permanent damage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The shock of the accident, especially
    watching one of our best friends die a horrible death, was something that
    dispirited the rest of us for many months. Instead of high school graduation
    being one of the happiest times of our lives, it was one of the saddest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At Zeke's wake, one of his uncles, who was a
    Chicago cop, strong-armed two of my friends. "What really happened that
    night?" he demanded. He was sure that there was more to the story than
    just a plain accident, but there wasn't. Our reputation was such that we
    were being accused of roguery even when none existed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the time of my
    graduation in June 1942, I was still only seventeen years old and not
    eligible for the draft until my birthday in late August. I could not take
    the tests to be an Air Cadet, which was what the Army Air Force called its
    pilot trainees, until that time. Because I had never considered going to
    college, I decided to go to work as soon as I was old enough to apply for a
    full-time job. Our family's extremely difficult financial condition during
    the Great Depression helped solidify my parents' feelings higher education
    was not economically feasible, and we children had no alternative but to
    accept that philosophy. Their financial picture was improving in the early
    1940s, but the decade-long period when they needed every last penny to pay
    for the necessities of life was still vivid in their minds, and it would
    remain there for the rest of their lives. In brief, this "Depression
    Mentality," as some people call it, meant that our economic,
    educational and resulting social prospects were limited. The only
    possibility of college ever discussed in our home was my older brother Jim
    and I could go to Chicago Teachers College, live at home and work part time
    to pay the tuition. In 1942, my mother, and to some degree my father, felt
    being a school teacher in Chicago's public school system was one of the best
    jobs there was, and maybe it was the only option available to us. After all,
    weren't the teachers paid during the worst days of the depression? My aunt,
    already a schoolteacher, probably knew someone who could pull some strings-a
    prerequisite for getting any job with the City of Chicago-to get us into the
    college. It was an option that had no appeal to my brother or me. With
    college ruled out, the alternative was to go out and find a job.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The country
    roared into the mass production of material to fight the war. Existing
    industrial businesses were converted from producing civilian equipment to
    war supplies. No new cars were being produced. All the automobiles
    manufacturing plants were converted into assembly plants for military
    airplanes, tanks, Jeeps, trucks, and other wartime vehicles. Companies that
    had produced refrigerators, washing machines, furniture, clothing, and
    almost any other product that was part of civilian life before the war were
    retooled to make products for the war effort. People were working overtime,
    and there were three shifts, around the clock, seven days a week, at
    companies where not too long before work was unavailable. Women were moving
    into jobs in manufacturing and construction that had previously been
    occupied only by men. Many employment opportunities that ordinarily would
    not have been available to them were opened because men were leaving for the
    armed services.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The civilian population on the home front did its part for
    the war effort. They bought war bonds to help finance the armament effort,
    and there were bond rallies, usually with movie stars or other celebrities
    giving speeches. People who could not afford to purchase a whole bond were
    encouraged to buy ten and twenty-five cent stamps to save for a full one.
    Rubber, scrap metal, and even aluminum foil (called "tin foil" at
    the time) were saved and then taken to collection sites. Ration stamps were
    issued to everyone for sugar, meat, coffee, and butter, which were in short
    supply. Housewives saved cooking grease in coffee cans and turn it in at the
    butcher shops where it was redeemed for meat ration stamps.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Gasoline, too,
    was rationed, which greatly decreased the amount available for recreational
    purposes. There were three classes of ration stamps for gasoline, A, B, and
    C. Every automobile displayed one of the letters on its windshield and
    drivers used coupon books at the gas station. Most people had an A card that
    rationed you to three gallons per week. My father worked as a draftsman for
    a metal fabricating company in Gary, Indiana, that had converted to the
    manufacture of parts for tanks. Because it was considered a war industry and
    he had a long commute to get to work, he had a C card. Even though it
    allowed him more gasoline, my use of the car was usually limited to trips to
    the store.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many other changes were happening in America because of the war.
    Air raid captains were designated throughout Chicago, and meetings were held
    on what to do in case of a raid by enemy planes. Vegetable gardens-known as
    Victory Gardens-were created on many empty lots in the neighborhood.
    Flagpoles sprang up around the neighborhood and there was always a patriotic
    civilian who raised and lowered the American flag every day. Nylon stockings
    for women went on the market for the first time, and they were a huge
    success because of their durability compared to the silk ones used up until
    that time. The new nylons were hard to get and much in demand by women.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> One
    unusual thing happened in the early years of the war. A family named Japp
    was the major producer of potato chips in the Chicagoland area, and the name
    was prominently displayed on all of their products. It was a promotional
    nightmare for the company because the term "Jap" was starting to
    be used as an obscenity. Immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack the brand
    name was changed to Jay's, as it remains today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The American Red Cross held
    blood drives, and many civilians willingly volunteered. Later, the Red Cross
    would organize a program to send aid packages to American prisoners of war
    (POWs) in addition to their other charitable work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The American government
    put out a steady and comprehensive stream of information to spur the people
    on to greater accomplishments in the war effort. Some of it was
    inspirational and patriotic; some was an effort to paint the people of the
    Axis countries as savage and ruthless enemies. Special aim was taken at
    their leaders, Adolph Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo. Tojo was
    the Premier of Japan who installed and oversaw a civilian cabinet comprised
    of hard-line military men like himself. He was picked as the Japanese leader
    we should hate other than the Emperor. Tojo looked more sinister, and
    therefore made a better villain than the Emperor, who was usually pictured
    riding a white horse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Propoganda Poster" vspace="8" src="images/Poster_1_11.jpg" width="412" align="left" height="570">Patriotic information was presented in movies,
    magazines, newspapers, posters, and by radio. It was not described by our
    country as propaganda. That was what the enemy countries put out. As an
    example, posters were placed in stores, schools, and public meeting places
    with headings that read: <i> Remember December 7th; We Can Do It; It's a Woman's
    War Too; United We Win; Use It Up, Wear it Out; He's Watching You; A Slip of
    the Lip Could Sink a Ship (See Fig. 11); and Stamp 'em Out</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Hollywood
    war movies produced always depicted the enemy as sneering and sadistic
    barbarians. We began to really hate the people of the enemy countries, not
    just their leaders, because we believed all the bad things we heard about
    them. I'm sure that this information stimulated many young men to enlist in
    the military services, but the enthusiasm to get the enemy, as depicted in
    the movies, was somewhat overblown. Many of the men I knew who enlisted did
    so just before they were to be drafted in order to have the option of
    getting into a certain branch of the military. Others waited until they were
    drafted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The young men of the country seemed to willingly accept their
    responsibility and duty of service. With a very few exceptions, they did so
    without complaining or without any promise or expectation of reward. It was
    just the thing to do. Among my friends and the young men in my neighborhood,
    there was also a great degree of peer pressure. Nobody would even think of
    being different by refusing to serve because they knew that their friends
    and neighbors would ostracize them. Married men and those who were older
    were not always as eager to serve. Nevertheless, few refused to do so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My
    brother Jim was drafted and after a short stint at Fort Leonard Wood,
    Missouri, was sent to Minnesota, where he spent most of the war years with a
    meteorological outfit. Other friends of mine joined the Marines and the Army
    Air Force.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was just one conscientious objector in our neighborhood.
    (That was the official name for draft resisters.) Everyone seemed to know
    his name but no one knew him personally, or at least they would not admit
    it. My friends and I referred to him as we would a leper.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Patriotic music
    was played frequently at public events. Movie theaters and radio stations
    ended their programs every evening with The Star Spangled Banner. We all got
    goose bumps when Kate Smith sang God Bless America. We knew all the words to
    the music for each of the military services: the Army's The Caissons Go
    Rolling Along; the Navy's Anchors Aweigh; the Marines Hymn; and the Song of
    the Army Air Force because we heard them so frequently, especially in movies
    and on the radio.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Before too long, casualty lists were being published in
    the newspapers. Everyone checked them diligently to see if there was anyone
    who they knew.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first American heroes of the war were presented to the
    people. They were usually pilots like the Marines' Gregory "Pappy"
    Boyington, who was known for shooting down a large number of Japanese planes
    in the Pacific Theater of Operations. While the pilot deserved all the
    acclaim he received, depicting a pilot's heroic deeds was also a sanitary
    way to portray the war. There was no blood, no cries of pain, no dead
    bodies, and no horrible pictures of mutilation. Pappy shot down enemy
    planes, they fell into the ocean, and that was the end of that.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The
    glorification of Boyington's heroic actions was meant to spur on the
    civilian population to bigger and better goals, and it worked. The
    newspapers, magazines and newsreels in movie theaters followed a similar
    pattern by giving us an unrealistic version of what was going on in the war.
    They did not show the darker side of what was happening. No pictures were
    ever shown of a dead American serviceman. Like most of the others who were
    about to go into service, I still had some kind of a romantic notion about
    what the army and other branches of the service were all about. Looking back
    on it, nothing could have really prepared me for what I was about to
    witness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A couple of my friends enlisted in late 1942, and they came home on
    furlough to tell us what it was like in the service. The stories usually
    centered on some of the unusual people they had met and the effect stringent
    military training had on them. None of them had been overseas yet, so we did
    not get any combat stories. Those would come later.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first one of our
    gang to get into a combat situation was Tom Broderick. He enlisted in the U.
    S. Merchant Marine Cadet Midshipmen program in early 1943 (See Fig. 12).
    After a ten week training program at their academy in Kings Point, New York,
    he boarded a freighter and joined a 280-ship convoy to North Africa. <img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Tom Broderick" vspace="8" src="images/Tom_Broderick_1_12.jpg" width="400" align="right" height="564"> They
    sailed across the perilous Atlantic Ocean and through the Mediterranean Sea,
    where the fear of German U-boat attack was at an all time high. We did not
    get his stories about this adventure until after the war because most of us
    were in the service by the time he came home on leave. Tom's adventures
    would not end there. After another trip across the sea as a midshipman, he
    decided that he wanted to become more directly active in the war effort. He
    resigned his Navy Reserve Commission after seven months and joined the
    Army's Infantry to become a paratrooper. He was assigned to the 82nt
    Airborne Division. He would be involved in one of the major operation of the
    war in Europe and he would receive a debilitating wound that would greatly
    affect the rest of his life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Waiting To Go Into Service</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When I reached my eighteenth birthday in
    August, I registered for military service with the local draft board as
    required by law. I took a cursory physical exam, and was given a
    registration card stating I was classified as 1-A. This meant I was subject
    to be called up for service whenever I was needed or when they had room for
    me. I knew they were taking the older men first, and it would be some months
    before I would be called up for service. Because I was having such a good
    time with my friends, many of whom were still civilians, I decided to bide
    my time until I was ready to take the Air Cadet tests for pilot training
    while keeping a careful eye out to make sure I beat the call-up from the
    draft board. Meanwhile, I decided to take a full-time job.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By this time,
    Chicago had a great reservoir of jobs available because of the war effort,
    and there were many booming industries from which to select. Three of the
    leading ones in my neighborhood were the stockyards, railroads, and steel
    mills.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I got a job with Carnegie Illinois Steel Company's South Works (later
    U.S. Steel Corporation). Their mill was located on the shore of Lake
    Michigan, about three miles east of the apartment building where our family
    lived. It offered a great source of employment to the area. The drawback was
    the heavy dose of airborne soot discharged on a daily basis. Extreme
    measures had to be taken in order to maintain a clean house. In our home, we
    washed down the painted walls at least twice a year, and curtains were
    washed every month. We thought everyone lived in an atmosphere like that.
    Because everyone has to have someone to look down on, we laughed at and to
    some degree pitied, those South Siders who lived about ten miles northwest
    of us near the Union Stock Yards where cattle and pigs were slaughtered and
    processed. The area was known as Back of the Yards. "How can they stand
    to live with that overpowering smell?" we said. It never occurred to us
    that some people were saying, "How can those people live so near the
    steel mills with all of that dirt in the air?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For my first job at the
    mill, I worked out of the basement of the Chemical Laboratory Building.
    Every hour or so, I walked about a mile over to the blast furnaces to pick
    up samples of iron that had just been made. The first part of the trip took
    me over a long bridge (See Fig. 13). While I did not consider my job
    dangerous, at least in comparison to some others in the mill, it was
    anything but commonplace. At each pick-up point, I had to walk across a
    three foot wide bridge set about eighteen inches above a stream of molten
    iron heated to two-thousand degrees. With my well-covered elbows extended
    out to protect my face from the heat, my thought always was, Walk fast but
    not so fast that you might stumble. I worked one of three eight-hour shifts
    in a twenty-four hour day. Sometimes my work hours were from midnight until
    eight o'clock the next morning.</font></p>
    <p><img border="1" alt="Carnegie Illinois Steel Works 1942" src ="images/Carnegie_steel_1_13.jpg" width=600 height=556 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The mill was the biggest, dirtiest, noisiest,
    gloomiest, hottest, and the most exciting, interesting, dangerous place one
    would ever see. How could an industry like that exist so near a populated
    area and so few people knew what went on there? There were multiple tin
    buildings built on a massive scale. A hundred smoke stacks belched out black
    smoke or white steam. Coke ovens poured out a product that produced flakes
    of graphite so thick they polluted the air throughout the mill on a
    continuous basis. Ten blast furnaces, each the size of a football field and
    standing eight stories tall, discharged steam as they transformed raw
    materials into liquid iron that poured down troughs into ladle cars drawn by
    the mill's own railroad. Bessemer furnaces spouting flames into the sky.
    Many of the men who worked there wore the same heavy clothing-even in the
    middle of summer to protect against the greater heat of fresh made iron and
    steel-without ever laundering it. Everyone carried a lunch pail and wore
    either a wool cap or a felt fedora. There were tough jobs where men had to
    shovel tons of raw materials like manganese and nickel into blast furnace
    doors where steel was produced, then cover their faces with the shovel to
    keep from being burned. Overhead, five-hundred ton cranes picked up and
    moved massive ladles of liquid metal as easily as a widow handles her
    teacup. Teaming mills where the raw steel was poured into ingot molds and
    the long line of newly stripped ingots still red hot forced the workers to
    shield their faces as they passed them. Hot rolling mills with stands
    containing large rollers made to finite tolerances flattened slabs of
    red-hot steel after many passes, with each movement getting faster. Most of
    this heavy-gauged metal was going to be forged into weapons of war. There
    were cold rolling mills where the metal was downsized sometimes to
    paper-thin thickness under such great pressure it could be done when the
    metal was cold and pickling vats loaded with acid hundreds of feet long.
    Tinning mills with a mass of integrated machinery were lined up so far that
    you could not see from one end to the other. Metal flew through the
    machinery at lightning speed, becoming steel to be shaped into containers
    for military ration, Campbell's soup, barrels and hundreds of other
    products. In the structural mill I-beams and wide-flanged beams were shaped
    into basic structures for new ships and other wartime uses we knew little
    about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were men in lousy positions who worked
    hard during all weather conditions and often had their lives on the line
    while doing their jobs. Laborers were paid less than a dollar an hour.
    Emergencies were a common occurrence. Whistles blew, sirens wailed, men
    scurried about as near panic set in. Spilled acid, furnaces leaking molten
    metal, ladles spilling, red-hot sheet metal bunching up on the rollers,
    tipped ingots, and other calamities were common occurrences. With the
    everyday carelessness of men doing repetitive jobs, it was a real wonder why
    there were not more accidents than there were. Men working there had
    unordinary titles like Cinder Snapper, Roller, Blower, Yard Man, and Tapper,
    and they were proud of them. Laborers would point out a Blower with the same
    admiration as they would a baseball star because they knew that it was a
    high-paying job.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the fellows working in the same
    department had gone to high school with me. His name was John Boswell and we
    often worked the same shift doing the same job. Even though he was not a
    close friend of mine, we began to do a few things together after work. Every
    Friday when we completed our shift, we would go to a tavern near the mill to
    cash our checks and enjoy their great fish fry and a couple of draft beers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In October of 1942, while working at the
    steel mills, I decided to apply to be an Air Cadet. It was to be the first
    step in reaching my long-range plan of being a pilot. I talked John Boswell
    into joining me. He had no special interest in flying, but I convinced him
    it would be an exciting way to spend our time in the service and as an added
    bonus, an officer's uniform adorned with silver flying wings looked great.
    We arranged our schedules at the mill so we could go to downtown Chicago for
    the tests.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">First, we took a six-hour written exam. We
    were both notified several weeks later that we had passed, and a date was
    set to take an extensive physical examination. This test took about four
    hours, and everything seemed to be going well. After the testing, a doctor
    sat down with me and told me I had a very rapid pulse that was going to
    disqualify me. He said it was probably from being too anxious, and he gave
    me every opportunity to pass, even allowing me to rest on a cot. But my
    pulse rate never went down, and I was told to wait and take the exam again.
    He said I could not take it for a year unless I was in some branch of the
    service. Then I could take it sooner. I can't describe how disappointed I
    was, but I did not give up my desire to fly. John passed his physical, and
    soon after that, he began his flight instruction at an air base in Texas. He
    would send me letters telling about what he was doing, and I read them with
    envy and jealousy. I went back to working at the steel mill and kept taking
    my pulse. It seemed to be a little above average but not exceedingly so. I
    decided to wait until I was drafted and then retake the tests again as soon
    as I could.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By the spring of 1943, most of my friends
    were in the armed forces. When it took a bit longer than I had expected for
    my turn to come up, I began to feel uncomfortable about still being a
    civilian. Many years later, I found out there was such a large source of
    draftees and enlistees they were filling the military quotas. Training camps
    were full, and they were having a problem with too many candidates and not
    enough facilities to process them. But, they would finally get around to me
    as one of the millions who were destined to serve.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My friends and I had spent many hours seeking
    out exciting and adventuresome activities. We were about to get more of both
    than we had ever bargained for. Some would pay a heavy price</font></p>
