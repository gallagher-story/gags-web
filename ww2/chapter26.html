    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From the time we first landed on the
    continent at Le Havre up until our arrival in Antwerp, we had little contact
    with anyone except those in our own battalion. Therefore, the concept of
    anyone dealing in the black market had been a non-issue. We had been given a
    couple of talks about the penalties for selling Army equipment but we paid
    little attention to it because no one had ever had the opportunity to do so.
    The warning meant nothing to us. The only thing relating to the black market
    we had heard about, other than talks, was an occasional article in Stars and
    Stripes telling about some soldier who had been caught. The resulting
    punishments were quite severe. According to the rumors, any GI caught
    selling gasoline when the European war was in progress would be shot by a
    firing squad. Whether this was true or not, nobody would even think of
    testing the rumor.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While doing MP duty in Antwerp, we began to
    deal with a lot of people other than those from our own outfit. There were
    local civilians, GIs from all over Europe, merchant seamen from around the
    world, and a mixture of soldiers from Britain, Canada, France, and other
    countries. In our work, and even while out on a pass, we came in contact
    with them on almost a daily basis and soon learned there was an extensive
    black market operating in that town. Our first introduction came in a subtle
    way, like a civilian approaching us and asking if we wanted to sell a pack
    of cigarettes. Just to put things into perspective, cigarettes were the most
    desirable commodity in Europe at that time. They had become a medium of
    exchange and in many cases, people would rather be paid in American
    cigarettes than in money from any country. They could be bartered for
    anything and were more in demand than currencies. No matter what you paid
    for them, if you tried hard enough, you could always make a profit on them.
    If you sold a pack, the next question always was, "Do you have any
    more?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We each had a ration book that allowed us to
    buy one carton of American-made cigarettes per week for fifty cents a
    carton. I had two cards and got double the allotted amount. When the battery
    clerk was passing out the cards, I had been on duty. When I went in to see
    him to get mine, he said they had all been passed out except mine. He had
    two left and he gave me both of them. Because I did not smoke, I always had
    double the allotment to sell or trade. We soon learned we could walk out of
    the PX where we bought them and the first person who followed us with his
    eyes as we left the building would give us twenty-five dollars for a carton.
    He might try to haggle on the price, but it always came back to the same
    twenty-five dollars. He would pay us in Belgian government francs we would
    then convert back into Army scrip or American dollars (greenbacks) at the
    camp money center. It seemed like such a simple way to make some fast
    spending money, but we also knew it was dealing in the black market, which
    was illegal. Because we did not want anything to interfere with our eventual
    trip home and a fast discharge, we were always worried about getting caught
    and being made an example of. Because of that, we usually, but not always,
    sold our cigarettes through an intermediary who was one of our Army buddies.
    Certain men looked at the whole black market game as a chance to make some
    big and fast money for a minimal amount of work. They paid us twenty dollars
    a carton and sold it for whatever they could get. There were stories about
    them taking bundles of them to Paris where the price was higher. Some who
    found it easy to make fast money on cigarettes started to deal in the black
    market of currencies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The American military forces had their own
    currency. Because the banking and financial institutions in continental
    Europe were in shambles after the war, the Americans printed and supervised
    the distribution of their own scrip for each country. For example, while we
    were in Antwerp, we were paid in Belgian Allied Military Francs, printed in
    the United States for our use, and the civilians had their
    own currency. The given denominations were supposed to be equal, but this
    was not the case on the black market.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soldiers were coming into Camp Tophat from
    all over Europe, and they had a lot of different types of currencies with
    them (See Fig. 162). The Army had set up exchanges where they could change one currency for
    another at the legal rate. Those going home to the States obviously wanted
    American greenbacks. This money had a yellow seal on its face to distinguish
    it from U.S. currencies back in the States, which had a blue seal, but I
    never found out why they did this. The money with a yellow seal was just as
    good as the other because I spent some of it when I got home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We soon learned there were two exchange rates
    going: the official, or legal rate, and the black market rate. We could buy
    about twice the number of francs on the black market with greenbacks as we
    could get at the legal rate. The illegal procedure being practiced was to
    sell American dollars for Belgian or French francs on the street in Antwerp
    at the black market rate and then turn around and exchange the francs for
    American dollars at Camp Tophat at the legal rate. It was doubling our money
    and it was so easy. The fellow who had the bunk next to me was really into
    the whole thing. He was working with several men from another battery. They
    wore different variations of their uniforms-disguises if you please-so the
    moneychangers at the camp would not recognize them when they showed up so
    frequently. They were flashing around big rolls of bills and sending some of
    it home. At one time, my neighbor told me that he had made over ten-thousand
    dollars (remember that in 1945, you could buy a nice house for less than
    this amount of money) in less than a month, and he did a lot more after
    that. He and his buddies were so eager to make as much money as possible;
    they were like gold-rush prospectors who had gone crazy looking for the
    mother lode. They spent every spare minute they had while not on duty
    planning ways to exchange currencies, and they never got caught.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite the temptation, most of us stayed
    away from the money exchange game. Again, the only thing that mattered at
    this point was to make sure nothing interfered with our getting out of the
    Army. Also, money laundering was considered to be a much more serious
    infraction than selling cigarettes, and it could lead to a dishonorable
    discharge or jail time. I'm sure that those involved did not think of it in
    that way because they were making some big money.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Other items belonging to the Army were sold
    on the black market, the primary one being gasoline. Gasoline was much in
    demand by civilians, and their sources of supply were almost non-existent.
    They were willing to pay exorbitant prices for it. The only case involving
    this activity we heard about involved a soldier from one of the other
    batteries in our battalion. He was a real loser and had been in trouble all
    through the time he was with us. He was the same GI who had walked into a
    civilian home near Nuremberg during the war and robbed the occupants of an
    elaborate silver tea set at gunpoint. The British MPs and some MPs from our
    outfit caught him in Antwerp. The British had staked out the civilian house
    of his girlfriend from which he operated and called our men in to help them
    because we had the only loaded guns. After his capture, the MPs were offered
    a large sum of money (forty-thousand dollars, was the figure we heard) to
    let him go free but they refused. After a court-martial, he was convicted
    and sent back to the States. We heard he was to serve time in prison, so
    either the penalty of a firing squad for dealing in the black market had
    been lifted when the war in Europe was over or it never existed in the first
    place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Army executed just one GI during combat
    and that was for deserting his position.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our attitude toward the black market was
    ambivalent at best. On one hand, we were now part of the local police force
    with our assignment being to bring offenders to justice. On the other hand,
    we were dealing in illegal activity ourselves if only on a limited basis.
    For most transactions, we set our own rules where we used intermediaries to
    sell our cigarette ration and excused them for doing so. If the fellow in
    the next bunk to us was a major dealer, we turned our back. If he was in
    another battery, and was not a nice guy, we looked on him being caught as
    justice done. The double standard did not make any sense, but that's the way
    it was. Also, the new freedom we were afforded with many passes and extended
    furloughs required more money. When our movements were restricted during the
    war and we were confined in camps after it, there was no place to spend
    money, but now that had changed. Our Army pay did not allow us to do the
    things we wanted. Black market money filled the void. One of the frequently
    heard comments was, "It's not illegal if you don't get caught."</font></p>
