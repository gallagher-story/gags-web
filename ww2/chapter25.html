    Destruction of Germany</b></font>
</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We passed through Regensburg, Nuremberg, and
    Wurzburg, all battered towns we had seen before. There were many completely
    or nearly totally destroyed. We thought again, how can these towns ever get
    back to normal?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">However, for the first time, we began to see
    signs of people trying to clean up their communities. Lines of people were
    set up to pass bricks, pieces of concrete and other debris from person to
    person until they finally reached some horse drawn dumpster. There were
    workers with shovels removing debris from sidewalks and from bombed
    buildings. The labor force consisted almost<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Camp Tophat" vspace="5" src="images/Camp_Tophat_Sign_25_155a.jpg" width="300" align="right" height="263"> entirely of women, and
    everything was being done by hand. We began to see more civilians than when
    the war was in progress, and it was amazing so many of them still remained
    despite such devastation to their homes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we passed through a town, women pushed
    their children up to the edge of the road to beg for candy. They had learned
    the words chocolate (they pronounced it chok-o-lot) and gum and sang them
    out as we passed. This was a change, during the war the civilians ignored us
    as we rode through their towns. We ran out of our supply of candy in a hurry
    and began throwing gum and the small sugar packets accumulated from when we
    were living on rations. We had a lot of these items left and we realized we
    would never use them. Finally, only Stevens had anything left and he
    continued to toss things to the children. "I thought they would like
    these chlorine tablets," he announced with glee.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"You dumb idiot," cried Armbruster.
    "You could kill them if they eat those things. What the hell's the
    matter with you." Dillon knocked the box out of Stevens's hand and we
    all took turns chastising him. We looked out the back of the truck and saw
    children down on their knees retrieving the tablets from the shoulder of the
    road. We were reminded Stevens continued to do stupid things on a regular
    basis that in some cases, like this one, could have dangerous repercussions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first night out we bivouacked near the
    town of Ashaffensburg, Germany. It was more a pile of rubble than a town.
    The GIs who manned it called the tent city area where we stayed Camp Lucky.
    How ironic; there was nothing lucky about the town or any of the area around
    it. The next day we crossed the Rhine River on a steel truss bridge the
    American engineers had built to replace the pontoon bridges that were
    hurriedly constructed soon after the initial assault across the river. We
    passed through the town of Oppenheim, where the Third Army had made their
    first crossing of the Rhine River as they advanced into Germany. We then
    passed through Mainz and the next night we stayed at the town of Tier, where
    we slept on our trucks. The next morning, we passed out of Germany, through
    Luxembourg, and into Belgium.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the most interesting towns we saw was
    Bastone. This was the site made famous in books and movies years later as
    the location where the Americans held out against insurmountable odds when
    the German army made their last major counteroffensive into the Ardennes
    Forest. It was Hitler's last desperate effort to stop the American and
    British advances from the west. He threw most of his reserved divisions into
    the Allied lines with the intent of cutting their forces in two and
    advancing all the way to Antwerp, Belgium. The Germans called the operation
    Watch on the Rhine. The Allies had later referred to it as The Battle of The
    Bulge because of the indentation it made in the front line of battle. There,
    in Bastone, General Anthony McAuliff responded to the Germans' order to
    surrender with a one-word reply: "Nuts." It was considered the
    pivotal point in stopping the Germans advance and the start of the Allied
    counterattack. The town looked like a lot of other damaged places we had
    seen, but here, there were many troop-carrying gliders lying about. From the
    condition of many of them, it was obvious a lot of Americans had died.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We passed through several towns including
    Eghezee and Louvain (or Leuven). The Belgian towns were not nearly as
    damaged as those in Germany. We realized again that even though major
    battles had been fought in these areas, the devastating damage to cities,
    like we had seen in Germany, was done by Allied bombings. With all the heavy
    fighting and shelling that took place in Bastone, the destruction paled in
    comparison to a city like Nuremberg.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived in Antwerp, Europe's
    second-largest port city, on a sunny afternoon. We had to go through the
    busiest part of town in order to get to the camp. A large crowd of people
    lined both sides of the street. Many of them were waving and cheering. At
    first, we thought we were getting a hero's welcome. Then we noticed it was
    not us that they were watching. There was a bicycle race going on, and we
    were in the middle of the contestants (See Fig. 155b). Oh well, it was a nice thought.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Bike race, Antwerp, near Schelde River" src ="images/Bike_Racers_Antwerp_25_155b.jpg" width=550 height=769 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived at the outskirts of Camp Tophat
    (See Fig. 155a), our final destination. Officially, it was known as
    Headquarters, United States Staging Area, Antwerp, Belgium, A.P.O. 562. It
    was a huge tent city set up to process American troops who were either going
    back to the States or to the Pacific Theater of Operations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we approached our final destination, we
    were about to participate in one of Captain Mc Kee's grand adventures. His
    presence during convoys always brought back unpleasant memories. We resented
    his egotistical dispensing of the rules of military courtesy while training
    in the States and wondered about his priorities while in the ETO. He was
    about to put icing on the cake.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">McKee decided since all the trucks were now
    equipped with radios, he was going to use them for maneuvers. During the
    convoy from Germany, he had used them to give orders for certain trucks to
    turn, stop, change positions, etc. He now planned on having all the trucks
    turn off the road and into an open field near the camp in a prescribed
    military manner. The site was to be our new gun park. He gave each truck a
    number before we left Straubing, and the drivers were warned, not to forget
    it. The plan called for the first ten trucks to turn off the road at the
    same time at a right angle to the road. The following ten trucks would
    follow behind the first batch, upon command, followed by the next ten and so
    forth. Again, he was playing at some kind of a military game that did not
    make sense to us. When we got alongside the field, he gave the first
    command, "Trucks one through ten, by the right flank, turn." We
    were one of the ten trucks, and we headed into the open field.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It turned out the field was a peat bog, and
    all the trucks began to sink into the ground. While the drivers immediately
    realized the problem, there wasn't much they could do about it. With the
    guns attached to the rear of most of them and trailers to others, it was
    impossible to back out. In just a couple of minutes, our truck had sunk down
    over its wheels. The two trucks to our right were in deeper than that. The
    next ten trucks behind us had started in but most of them were able to stop
    when they saw our predicament.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At first, we just sat there in disbelief as
    we could feel the truck slowly going down. Finally, we realized we had
    better get out of there and started to throw our personal things out of the
    truck. We followed after them. We thought we were about to sink into a deep
    swamp and we were bailing out to try our luck on foot. We picked up our
    gear, and headed back to the road in panic mode. Every step we took made a
    loud sucking noise, and we would sink in up to the top of our boots. When we
    reached the road, we stood there and watched the truck drivers struggling.
    We didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Dillon said to me with great irony
    in his voice, "Captain Bowlegs has struck again."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of the trucks still up on the road
    immediately began to use their winches to pull the trucks and guns out of
    the bog. There was near hysteria as officers and high-ranking noncoms showed
    up to shout commands and offer conflicting advice. It was such a unique
    experience that no one knew precisely how to handle it. Most of the trucks
    had been buried to the tops of their wheels, but several were in so deep I
    don't know how they ever got them out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After several hours most of the trucks were
    still stuck. Some empty trucks from the camp arrived, and we loaded up on
    them with our bags, rifles, and other equipment. As we left, our truck
    driver, Grimes, was still out in the bog, using up all his swear words. He
    joined us in the camp about twelve hours later looking like he had been
    dragged through a swamp, which, come to think of it, he had. He arrived
    after we had retired in our new quarters and his ranting woke us all up. He
    was livid. All I could think was: I hope he doesn't start expounding how
    someone out to kill that dumb sonofabitch like he did with Lieutenant Kraft
    in St. Goar. This time, the wrong person might hear him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It might have been our imaginations, but we
    seemed to see very little of Captain McKee around Camp Tophat after that
    incident.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>A Winner Of A Camp</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We soon learned this place had all the
    luxuries of a camp in the States. There were barbershops, movies, post
    exchanges, ice cream parlors, tailors, beer halls, moneychangers and a post
    office. The camp was divided into three areas, with one for those men who
    were being sent directly to the Pacific Theater of Operations, another for
    those going back to the States, and a third for the permanent cadre in the
    camp area. We were assigned to the third group, which made us very happy.
    Many of those men going to the States were to be sent on to the Pacific
    after a furlough at home, but they did not know it at the time. The ones
    making the direct route were the most unhappy GIs I had ever come across. I
    ran into a bunch of them one night in Antwerp and among their gripes, they
    listed a dozen reasons why it should have been someone else who should be
    sent before them. Most of the ones I met had seen a lot of action already
    and they felt it would be fairer to send men who had little or no contact
    with the enemy. They were absolutely right in their judgment but that wasn't
    how the Army worked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We felt as though we had really lucked out by
    being stationed in a camp with many amenities and located near a major city.
    The camp was west of Antwerp, with an automobile tunnel under the Schelde
    River connecting it to the city's downtown area. Of equal importance, we were only a short
    distance from some of the more desirable tourist spots in Europe, including
    Brussels and Paris.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Guarding German POWs</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In camp we lived in large, black tents that
    held twenty people each, and there were hundreds of them. The officers'
    billets and headquarters were in Quonset huts. We slept on army cots and we
    lived out of our duffel bags. We were told our duties would be taking German
    prisoners of war around the camp on work duties jobs (See Figs. 156 and
    157). We began to refer to them as POWs or just plain Germans instead of the
    more derogatory names like Krauts and Jerries we had used during the war.
    However, the civilians we met in Belgium and later in France still all
    referred to the Germans as the Boche, and just like the young girls we had
    met earlier in Luxembourg, the emphasis they put on the word made it sound
    like they were talking about someone for whom they held great contempt.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="German POWs at Camp Tophat" src ="images/German_POWs_erect_tents_Camp_Tophat_25_156.jpg" width=550 height=432 ></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="German POWs at Camp Tophat working" src ="images/German_POWs_lay_pipe_Camp_Tophat_25_157.jpg" width=550 height=424 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The prisoners who were to perform work
    details in Camp Tophat stayed at another camp nearby, and they were
    delivered and picked up every day by GIs from an infantry outfit that
    guarded them. Our new duty sounded pretty good to us, and it sure beat going
    to the Pacific Theater of Operations. Some of the tents were made into mess
    halls, and the cooks were serving some very good food. We started to get
    fresh fruit and vegetables and fresh meat. The milk was still being made
    from powder but, at least they cooled it down some, which really enhanced
    the taste.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Five days a week, I would be assigned about
    fifteen POW's to take on work details. We would go around the camp, and I
    would have them put up tents, fix others, rake the area, do KP duty, make
    minor road repairs, and other menial tasks.&nbsp; The GIs who were passing through had no
    duties to perform. I wore a .45-caliber pistol with ammunition and a holster
    on a gun belt (See Fig. 158). I always had one German with me acting as
    interpreter. He would be excused from work, so I spent a lot of time talking
    to him. One of these interpreters gave me the first idea I had about going
    to college when I got back home.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Bob Gallagher and German POWs" src ="images/Bob_Gallagher_and_German_POWs_25_158.jpg" width=550 height=432 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Most of the prisoners wore some type of the
    Wehrmacht uniform but there were also some Panzer (Armored Unit) and a few
    Waffen SS men (Germany's elite troops.) among them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The ages of the prisoners varied from about
    fifteen to seventy years old, but most were in the same age bracket as the
    American soldiers. Many of them had seen some long and brutal battles. Some
    had been in the army for ten years or more. The very old and young ones were
    usually new recruits, and they seemed to still be in a state of shock about
    their experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One young man, about fifteen years old told
    me through the interpreter that about a week before the end of the war,
    trucks pulled up to his secondary school, and all male students were sworn
    into the army, loaded up, and sent immediately to the front line to fight.
    He was given a rifle and taught how to load it, but he never fired. The day
    after he was conscripted, he was in a trench. The next morning, when
    daylight came, he and those he was with surrendered when they observed
    British tanks behind them. The older prisoners seemed to be able to keep up
    with the younger ones, but it might have been more of an attitude thing.
    Sometimes, the younger ones tried to goof off, while the older ones did not
    want to get into trouble and were more resigned to taking orders. Overall,
    we had no serious trouble with them, but there were a number of minor
    incidents. None of the prisoners tried to escape while we had this duty.
    However, I don't think keeping them from escaping had anything to do with
    our good soldiering. They were being fed, billeted, and clothed. Even though
    it was far from ideal circumstances, they knew the situation was much worse
    back in Germany, and they seemed to be in no hurry to get there. They knew
    that many people were starving back in their homeland because most of the
    relief aid had not yet been fully implemented. They talked about being
    anxious to rejoin their families, but I think in many cases it was just lip
    service. Also, the fact they had lost the war may have had a lot to do with
    it. There would be no returning heroes to be honored, parades to acknowledge
    a job well done, or benefits to be distributed. They were the losers, and
    that fact alone may have made it difficult to go home and face the people of
    their hometown whose leaders had led them to hold in such great expectations
    from their military men.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The prisoners wanted to know the specifics of
    the damage sustained by some of their hometowns, where we had been. They did
    not like to hear the usual answer: "It was totally destroyed." We
    would end these conversations by saying: "Germany is kaput,"
    "Hitler is kaput," or "Alles kaput." When I told the
    interpreter I was from Chicago, he translated it to the other German
    prisoners and several of them held their arms out in front and make the
    rat-a-tat sound of a machine gun as they all broke out in laughter. Most of
    them new little English but they all seemed to know the words Chicago,
    gangster, and Capone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many of the prisoners were interested in
    America and, through the interpreter, would ask many questions about our
    cities and cultures, especially movies and music. The prisoners we got to
    know were not much different than the GIs we knew. They did not appear to be
    the cruel monsters American propaganda had led us to believe they were. This
    made it difficult for us to understand the terrible things that had happened
    at the hands of the German people. The leaders alone could not have done the
    dirty work alone. Were some of these prisoners the men who had done
    everything in their power to waste the GIs they had met? Did they subject
    our country's POWs and many civilians to unspeakable crimes in slave labor
    camps and other places of internment? If so, how could they look so normal
    to us?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite our mixed views, our feelings toward
    the German prisoners were pretty neutral. We didn't hate them, but we
    refrained from getting too chummy with them. We did not yet know a lot about
    the atrocities the Germans had committed. We had only seen from a distance
    some of the camps with their inmates. Most of the more horrendous
    information came out a few months later, or at least, we didn't hear about
    it until then. Also, we had seen so much death and suffering in Europe that
    all stories about death camps, slave labor camps, atrocities, deaths inside
    prisoner-of-war camps, destruction of cities with their civilian population
    and military deaths were all lumped together. We had become very jaded about
    the horrors of suffering and death. One way of dying or suffering was not
    looked on as being any different than any other. We made no effort to read
    up on or to become informed about these subjects. It was easier to put it
    out of our minds as much as that was possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We looked at the prisoners as the enemy from
    the war that was now over. Also, the attitude toward the Germans, prisoners
    and civilians alike, had a lot to do with our exposure to them during the
    war. No one in my outfit had been killed or wounded by them. In contrast,
    the infantry unit guarding them when they were not with us treated the
    prisoners in Antwerp much more harshly. This outfit had seen a lot of action
    from North Africa on through Europe, and, without asking but judging from
    their campaign ribbons, I'm sure they had many casualties. That created a
    whole different attitude. From what they told us, they hated all Germans and
    the prisoners more than the civilians. They were ready to hand out severe
    punishment if any of the prisoners got even slightly out of line.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As an example, at the end of a workday, we
    brought the prisoners to a central location. There, they were counted and
    loaded on trucks with infantry guards and sent to their camp. Before they
    boarded the trucks, we searched them. I had never searched anyone before and
    I was doing it on the first day we had that duty. I noticed that one of
    them, an interpreter, was trying to pull away from me as I felt around his
    back. I made him stand still and I found he had a woman's makeup compact
    hidden in his belt in the middle of his back. It contained butter from the
    mess hall where the prisoners had been doing KP that day. I didn't think too
    much about it other than he should not have done it, but the infantry
    soldiers reacted quite differently. They tied his hands behind his back
    before loading him on the truck. The next day, I heard from another German
    interpreter that the fellow who stole the butter got three days in the hole.
    It didn't sound very good, and, from the way the other prisoners referred to
    it, wasn't the place to be. When the POW returned to our work duties, he
    would not even make eye contact with me. When he arrived with the other POWs
    in the morning for duty, he would make a point of moving away from me so he
    would not be assigned to my group.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were other incidents where we heard
    severe punishment had been handed out for minor infractions. This created a
    small problem for members of our unit. Even though we had no reason to
    protect the prisoners, we sometimes hesitated in turning them in to be
    punished when the violation was minor. Things like stealing an orange or a
    piece of fruit out of the mess hall was a fairly common occurrence. Did you
    turn him in or not? The harsh treatment passed on to the prisoners for
    infractions made us hesitate to do so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For example: the twenty-man tent where I
    lived was right next to the kitchen where all of the meals were prepared for
    our unit and another battalion that did guard duty. When the side flaps of
    our tent were rolled up, we could look right into the mess hall. We could
    see the German POWs on KP duty preparing meals under the guidance of the
    kitchen personnel, who were GIs. One day, between meals, we heard a lot of
    commotion over there and went to investigate. Three prisoners had been
    caught stealing food and they were being punished on the spot. The three had
    been brought into an empty tent where a table and chairs were set up. A
    large number of spectators had shown up to watch. The men were sitting at
    the table with a one-half gallon can of peanut butter sitting before each
    man. As their punishment for stealing, they were being required to eat a
    full can with a tablespoon. By the time we got there, they were about a
    third of the way through and, were throwing up all over the place. Their
    faces were twisted in agony. It was very painful to watch and appeared
    extremely cruel. We stated our distaste for what was going on to the
    infantry soldiers who were dishing out the punishment but they just laughed
    at us. There was a first-sergeant among them, and he told us to keep our
    mouths shut. We finally left and never found out how the matter was
    concluded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another time, I was lying on my bunk reading
    when one of my bunkmates called my attention to a small frog, about the size
    of a quarter, hopping down the aisle between the rows of bunks. I figured it
    would probably wind up in someone's bedroll so I got up to get rid of it. I
    took a stick and putting it down next to the frog, started to golf it out of
    the tent. As I got to the door, there was a German POW interpreter standing
    there. He saw what I was doing and he yelled at me, "You beast, you
    beast!" I was dumbfounded. Was this really one of those sadistic
    Germans, we had heard so many horrible stories about, calling me a beast for
    moving (not killing) a mere frog? Before I could get my wits about me to hit
    him, one of the infantry GIs standing nearby, who had heard what went on,
    attacked the prisoner. It wasn't a pretty picture. They came and took the
    badly bloodied interpreter away, and I never saw him again. I made a point
    of not asking what had happened to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were some black soldiers being
    processed in Camp Tophat along with the other GIs, and it was puzzling to
    see how they interacted with the German POWs. They acted as though they were
    meeting long-lost relatives, and tried to befriend them as much as they
    could. They wanted to give them cigarettes, candy, and even liquor. We, as
    the guards, knew the prisoners were not supposed to get these items, but we
    sometimes had a hard time keeping the two groups apart. Perhaps the black
    GIs felt some kinship with the German POWs because they thought they, too,
    were being discriminated against. They may have seen some similarity in the
    way they were segregated from the white troops and were treated
    subserviently. The black GIs were not allowed the freedoms of the white
    soldiers and they probably pitied the German POWs who were also being
    forcefully constrained. We often discussed why this was happening but never
    came up with an answer we had one hundred percent confidence in. The
    attitude of the black soldiers was even more incongruous when we considered
    the Nazi government was so blatantly racist.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">An ugly incident resulted from this illegal
    pampering when a lieutenant from the infantry unit that guarded the
    prisoners came upon the mixing of prisoners and black soldiers. One of my
    friends was in charge of some prisoners, and he had them tightening up the
    ropes on tents. Several of them had been called into a tent where the black
    GIs were being billeted, and they were giving prisoners cigarettes and
    alcoholic drinks, among other things. We suspected the lieutenant had been
    alerted to the situation by one of his enlisted men because we seldom saw
    officers around the areas where work details were taking place. My detail of
    POWs was working in the same area, so, when I heard the loud talking, I went
    to investigate. When I arrived at the tent there was a lot of commotion
    going on and the lieutenant was threatening court-martial to the black
    soldiers. He was also yelling at my friend for not keeping the two groups
    apart. The prisoners involved were immediately taken back to the infantry
    camp where they were punished, but I never found out what happened to them
    or the GIs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The incident with the lieutenant did not stop
    the problem because there was no change in the way the black GIs acted
    toward the prisoners. About a week later, I had to stop some of them from
    giving cigarettes to POWs in my detail. The pattern continued because
    frequent turnover in troops brought in people who had not heard of the
    incident with the lieutenant. The bigger question was still what made all of
    the black GIs act so friendly to the recently defeated enemy?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the prisoners in my detail on a
    regular basis had been in the Waffen SS Panzer Division, Hitler's elite
    combat troops. He wore an all-black uniform, black leather riding boots, and
    had a six-inch scar down the side of his face. He looked very sinister, and
    the uniform added to his image. He looked like the villain from a Hollywood
    movie. When the prisoners were working, some of them would get some distance
    from me. Almost every day one of the transient GIs would come up to me to
    report this tanker was loose. It was interesting because they never said
    anything about any of the other prisoners. The fellow with the scar was
    really a very amiable person whenever I was around him and I talked with him
    on a number of occasions. Despite his looks, his personality did not come
    close to matching the stereotype of an arrogant and sadistic SS trooper as
    depicted in movies I had seen. If he was acting the part, he was doing a
    very good job. The only hint of his military training came when he reacted
    to any command I would give the POWs. His movements were quick, mechanical
    and resolute, including a clicking of the heels. He told me, through the
    interpreter, he had been in Lutheran Divinity School before the war and he
    was going back after he got home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One day he came out from behind an empty
    tent, carrying a handmade shoulder holster with a loaded Army .45-caliber
    pistol. Someone had thrown it out when he was ready to ship out of the camp.
    I now had two .45's. I had bought one from a GI for $15 just a few days
    prior. When I got ready to return home, months later, I sold both of them.
    We were being warned about the dire consequences of being caught with Army
    equipment but the German Luger pistol I had picked up in Alzey was
    considered a trophy, and I kept it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Honor Guard For President Harry Truman</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On July 14th, we were told President Truman
    was going to land at an airport near Antwerp the following day, and our unit
    was going to be part of the honor guard that greeted him. Following his
    arrival, he was going to SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary
    Force) Headquarters, which was located near Brussels. From there, he would
    be going on to Potsdam (a suburb of Berlin) to meet with Churchill and
    Stalin to make decisions regarding the division and occupation of Germany.
    The conference was to take place from July 17th to August 2nd and had the
    code name of Terminal. Officially it was known as the Berlin Conference.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We brushed our shoes, cleaned our rifles,
    pressed our uniforms, and got everything ready for the big day. We put a
    mixture of oil and gasoline on our steel helmets to make them shine, but it
    also made them smell. At about 0600 hours the next morning, we were loaded
    up on our two-and-a-half ton trucks and driven out to see the President. We
    had all seen newsreels of the heads of countries as they deplaned on foreign
    territory. After being greeted by dignitaries, they would walk up and down
    the aisle between the honor guard soldiers, who were standing at rigid
    attention. We were sure that was what we were going to do.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It wasn't.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">They deposited us on a country road in the
    middle of farmland, where we were spaced at ten-foot intervals on both sides
    of the road. We were so far from the airport we could not see or even hear
    the airplanes. Some genius had gotten the idea it would be a great tribute
    to the President to have soldiers lined up from the airport to SHAEF
    Headquarters. As far as we could see in both directions, there were soldiers
    standing on both sides of the road. We were all furious for being misled
    but, as usual, we just complained among ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In keeping with the Army's unwritten motto of
    hurry up and wait, nothing happened for hours. By noon we had been there for
    almost five hours, and we had seen no one but each other. There was no
    traffic. We were all getting tired, restless, and hungry as we had not eaten
    since breakfast. Because the ground was wet, and because we did not want to
    get our neatly pressed uniforms dirty, we had been standing in one place the
    entire time. At about 1330 hours, Jeeps and command cars started to come by
    with officers leaning out yelling, "Present arms! Present arms!"
    This meant we were to stand at attention with heels together, staring
    straight ahead, and holding our rifle in a vertical position, right in front
    of us. After about fifteen minutes of being in this uncomfortable position,
    not having eaten since early morning, and because of the boredom of it all,
    we started to wear down. The vehicles with officers kept coming, and we
    heard the same call to attention several dozen times. The enlisted men were
    grumbling to themselves, "We heard you the first time," or,
    "Don't panic fellows, it's only the President."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, some weapons carriers filled with
    luggage and some other vehicles went by that seemed to indicate the guest of
    honor was not far behind. From the speed of the vehicles passing us, I
    realized I might not even get a view of the President when he went by, so I
    decided to turn my head to the left, which was the direction he was coming
    from, to get a better view when he passed. I had just made my move when the
    convoy stopped, and I got the best view in town. Sitting right in front of
    me, about twelve feet away, were General Eisenhower, President Truman, and
    Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. They were in an open command car,
    sitting three abreast across the back seat. Truman was in the middle, and he
    looked bored to death. None of them were doing any talking. Then, utter fear
    set in as I realized General Eisenhower was on the side of the car nearest
    to me, and he was staring directly at me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">You would have to be an enlisted man to
    realize the significance of being the only one who was not standing at
    attention when you were looking at a five-star general. His title was
    Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces, which would have even set a
    one-star general into a panic under similar circumstances. Ordinarily, an
    officer of Eisenhower's rank would not be looking for such an insignificant
    breach of military discipline as a soldier's head being turned away from the
    norm, but in this situation he was being forced into it. He had been riding
    for many miles from the airport looking at nothing but GIs standing rigid
    like store dummies. The President of the United States, seated on his left,
    did not seem to be offering up any conversation as a diversion. I
    immediately jerked my head to the front where it should have been, but I
    knew he had seen me looking to the side. I felt like someone who jumped off
    of a thirty-story building while his whole life flashes in front of him.
    Fortunately for me, the convoy started up, and they drove by without him
    making an issue of it, but Eisenhower kept staring at me until he passed.
    Truman was holding the brim of his hat and I somehow got the impression he
    thought observing thirty plus miles of GIs standing at attention along the
    road was as dumb a stunt as we enlisted men did. Or maybe he was thinking
    about what he was going to do when he got hold of the guy who put him in an
    open car with the wind blowing in his face (See Fig. 159).</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="President Truman at SHAEF" src ="images/President_Truman_end_of_war_25_159.jpg" width=500 height=374 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On August 6, we heard the first atomic bomb
    was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan but we had no idea of its significance. Our
    news from around the world was still very limited. We had no radios, and the
    only newspapers came from the States and were always about a month old when
    we got them. We were not even getting a copy of the Stars and Stripes on any
    regular basis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On August 9, when the second bomb was dropped
    on Nagasaki, we began to get more particulars about the extensive damage
    that had been done, but there was no mention of the thousands of civilians
    who had been killed. We knew nothing about the term atomic bomb. We thought
    it was just some kind of a bigger bomb that did more damage. When we heard
    about the devastation to the Japanese cities, our thoughts went back to the
    many destroyed German cities we had seen. What could possibly be worse than
    that? There was no sympathy for the Japanese who died in the blasts, only
    hope the bigger bombs would bring a faster victory. We had all seen so much
    death, destruction, suffering, and misery not even the heavy toll resulting
    from the atom bombs could stir any sympathy. Also, we had been at war with
    the Japanese for almost four years and had been fed a steady diet of why we
    should hate them. At this point there were no good feelings about the
    Japanese, not even sympathy for their mass killing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At about this same time, we began to get more
    specific information about what would later be called the Holocaust. For
    those of us who had not participated in the liberation of concentration
    camps, news of them began to be made public only near the end of the war in
    Europe. We had known almost nothing about this tragic phase of a tragic war.
    Even the first reports we received were thought to be isolated incidents. It
    was not until some time later, primarily at the Nuremberg trials, that the
    full impact of what had happened hit us. Then I recalled seeing the horrible
    sight of emaciated bodies stacked up on hayracks in Frankfort some months
    earlier and wondered if there was any connection to the Holocaust victims.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Japanese Surrender - War Ends</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On August 14th, Japan accepted the Allies
    surrender terms and World War II ended. We let out a huge sigh of relief
    (See Fig. 160). August 15, 1945, was declared VJ (Victory in Japan) Day, and
    on September 8th the official signing took place aboard the battleship
    Missouri. There were a lot of hoops and hollers in our tent, and everyone
    talked about getting a pass into Antwerp to celebrate. More than anything
    else, there were a lot of happy people who walked around for days with big
    smiles on their faces. We were all fed up with Army life, and were looking
    forward to being civilians again. It was like a huge weight being lifted off
    of our shoulders. With the end of the war, we could now look forward to
    going home, and that made us all very happy indeed. It also removed a heavy
    burden from our minds. When Japan was still fighting, there was always the
    possibility we would be sent to the Pacific Theater to be made part of the
    invasion force of their mainland. It was something we talked about
    frequently. The sudden end to that war took us all by surprise, as it did
    people throughout the world. Now, there was much interest in the big
    question of when and how they would select men to go home.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Stars and Stripes - End of War" src ="images/Stars_and_Stripes_end_of_war_25_160.jpg" width=600 height=520 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We each got a rating number based on a point
    system that determined in what order we were to be demobilized. Those with
    the most points would go first. While the Army used the word demobilized, we
    GIs liked the word discharged because it had a more permanent ring to it. We
    got one point for each month of service, one point for each month spent
    overseas, five points for each campaign star, five points for each combat
    decoration, five points for each purple heart and twelve points for each
    child under 18 years old.1 I believe that I had about forty-five points. I
    knew there were many soldiers who had more points than I did and it would be
    some months before I would be going home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of the statistics on to the horrible
    cost of the war came in later. In addition to the millions of deaths
    throughout the world, there would be no way of measuring the enormous
    numbers of wounded. The suffering and damage done to property was
    immeasurable. We had seen some of the damage and had been shocked by it, but
    it was only a small fraction of what had taken place. World War II was the
    most costly war in history by any measurement.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Early estimates adopted by General of Army
    George C. Marshall gave total military casualties (battle deaths plus the
    missing unlikely to return) for the United States as 295,904.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Military Police Duty</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We continued to pull our guard duty with the
    German POWs until September 20th when we left Camp Tophat and moved across
    the Schelde River into the central part of the city of Antwerp, where we
    were made into a Military Police (MP) unit. We were billeted in the offices
    of a factory once used to process diamonds. These were permanent buildings,
    and the accommodations were much nicer than living in tents. It had been a
    long time since we had lived in anything but, and we considered it a big
    improvement. The hardwood floors, heated shower rooms, and central heat made
    life a lot more comfortable as we headed into the winter months.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The city of Antwerp had received less damage
    than to many of the other cities we had seen in Europe, and much of what had
    been damaged or destroyed had been cleaned up before we got there. There
    were some empty lots in the middle of heavily populated areas, which
    indicated buildings had recently been there. The civilians told us some of
    the hardships encountered during the German occupation and, later, the
    battle for the city. One of the worst parts was the constant rain of V-2
    rockets the retreating Germans sent down on the city after they had been
    driven out by Allied troops. They caused a great number of civilian
    casualties. The civilian population also suffered food shortages for a long
    period of time. Most of the shops were now open, but there was a shortage of
    goods to be sold. Rationing was still in effect, and people had to stand in
    long lines in front of food stores. Some cafes were open but served a
    limited menu. Most of the people seemed to be moving about in a near-normal
    atmosphere. The electric-powered streetcars were operating and doing a big
    business. Because there were not many automobiles, the streetcars were
    usually overcrowded. On many of them, people hung out of the doorways. GIs
    could ride free, but because of the crowded conditions we seldom did so. We
    walked or hitched rides on Army vehicles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our billets were on Pelikaanstr, within
    walking distance to the downtown area of the city, which made it easy to get
    around. We were only two blocks from the main street in town, De Keyser Lei
    (See Fig. 161). While we were there, there was a national political election
    and the GIs were introduced to the difference between elections in the
    United States and those in many foreign countries. There were near-riots in
    the streets and some real riots in one of the city's main squares. We were
    told to stay away from crowds of civilians, but it was sometimes hard to do.
    However, whatever the cause of such excitement, none of the open hatred
    between opposing political parties was aimed at us. The people were very
    friendly and accommodating.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Antwerp, Belgium, DeKaiser Street" src ="images/Antwerp_Belgium_DeKaiser_Street_25_161.jpg" width=600 height=412 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Antwerp was the diamond trade center of the
    world and just down the street from our quarters, across from Central
    (railroad) Station, men would ply their trade. On Saturdays, about a hundred
    of them would stand around outside of a particular building and haggle over
    the prices. Deals were consummated with a handshake.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Things were beginning to look up for members of our battalion. Morale was
    high and complaints were at a minimum. The food continued to be good, living
    conditions had improved, inspections were at a minimum, there were no
    special details to perform, passes were plentiful, and we started to plan
    furloughs to the scenic spots of Europe.</font></p>
