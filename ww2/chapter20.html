    <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
    arrived at our new site in the middle of an open farm field on April 20<sup>th</sup>. 
    &nbsp;Before we could find a place to billet, we moved again to another field 
    nearby.&nbsp; Some German boys who where about ten or twelve years old arrived 
    and helped us dig in (See Figs. 116 and 117) so we rewarded them with candy 
    bars and chewing gum.&nbsp; They made a big thing about the gum.&nbsp; Either they had 
    never had it before or it had been a long time.</span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Several of them spoke 
    English well.&nbsp; They wanted to know about the progress of the war, and we had 
    the impression their parents had put them up to the questioning.&nbsp; Unlike the 
    many adults we had seen in other areas, these boys seemed to be quite 
    happy.&nbsp; They laughed, smiled, and horsed around with each other like typical 
    preteens anywhere.&nbsp; It showed us young people were durable and positive 
    regardless of the circumstances.&nbsp; Either that, or they did not fully 
    understand what was going on around them.</span></font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Headquarters told us we would be at this location only for a short period of 
  time so we did not pitch our tents.&nbsp; Instead, we slept in the trucks after 
  unloading some of the equipment and setting up our kitchen, such as it was, in 
  a dilapidated lean-to next to a farmer’s barn (See Fig. 118) that leaked 
  badly when it started to rain.&nbsp; We had discussed the idea of running the 
  farmer and his family out of the farmhouse so we could take it over for a 
  billet.&nbsp; We talked about there being some kind of billet slips issued by the 
  American government for the lodging of soldiers in private homes.&nbsp; The 
  civilians would be reimbursed for the time spent there.&nbsp; Were they good in 
  Germany or just in allied countries?&nbsp; Where did we get the slips?&nbsp; Realizing 
  the procedure would take us through headquarters for answers, we decided 
  against the idea.&nbsp; The real restriction that kept us from running the 
  civilians out of their homes, and we did not want to discuss it, was that 
  nobody had the stomach to make the first move, a knock at the door.&nbsp; Despite 
  all the anti-German information we had been fed, we looked on the civilians 
  more in pity than in hate. </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img border="0" src="images/Temporary_Kitchen_Hanau_Germany_20_118.jpg" width="500" height="343"></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Our 
  location looked like typical farmland one might find in the States with some 
  big exceptions.&nbsp; There were open fields bordered by wooden rail fences.&nbsp; 
  Widely scattered farmhouses dotted the area.&nbsp; Unlike farms in the States, 
  where the animal barns are spaced some distance from the farmhouse, here they 
  were right up against the houses.&nbsp; It took us some time to realize that even 
  though the scene appeared quite natural, there was something different about 
  it.&nbsp; There were no animals, the fields were not cultivated for crops, and 
  there were no bales of hay for feed.&nbsp; No one was doing any work that you would 
  usually see on a farm.&nbsp; It was just another example of how the German people 
  were living.&nbsp; The cities and towns we had seen had all their life drawn out of 
  them, and even though there was less structural damage in the rural areas, 
  these people’s lives were anything but normal.&nbsp; Everyone in Germany had one 
  thing in common regardless of his or her age (maybe the preteens at this 
  location were the exception), social class, or geographic location.&nbsp; They were 
  living in a disconnected society that had no immediate hope of getting 
  organized.&nbsp; They were all feeling the same hardships.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  There had been some question about what we were supposed to be protecting with 
  our antiaircraft guns at several of the gun emplacements before this one, but 
  now we really wondered.&nbsp; We were out in the middle of a farmer’s field and the 
  only thing visible as far as we could see were more fields and a few scattered 
  farmhouses.&nbsp; The tranquil setting of the farm area made it difficult to 
  concentrate on our objective for being there (See Fig. 119).</span></font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  There was a country road close to our gun pit the civilians in the area used, 
  so the area was not completely devoid of something to observe.&nbsp; All travel was 
  on foot.&nbsp; But certainly there was no military strategic value to this site.&nbsp; 
  Once we got our telephone hooked up, we called headquarters.&nbsp; Once again, we 
  were breaking our self-imposed rule not to waste our time asking for 
  information when we knew it would not produce any meaningful answer.&nbsp; Was 
  there something just over the horizon?&nbsp; Was there the remote possibility we 
  could meet some ground forces?&nbsp; We knew absolutely nothing about where the 
  enemy was.&nbsp; They could have been a mile away or one hundred miles.&nbsp; We were 
  told nothing about what was going on around us.&nbsp; The only one we could contact 
  by phone from the CP was the battery clerk, so we asked him.&nbsp; He said he would 
  get back to us, and he did several hours later.&nbsp; The answer was the quote from 
  the officer of the day stating, “Tell those guys in gun section number one to 
  just do their job and stop sticking their noses into something that isn’t any 
  of their goddamn business.”</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">“We 
  never learn, do we?” commented Spearing.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">One 
  morning at this site, I was standing in the lean-to with Stevens and Bapst.&nbsp; 
  It was raining lightly, and I was wearing my helmet, rubber boots and a 
  raincoat over my other clothes.&nbsp; I was moving about in a futile effort to find 
  a dry spot where the rain would not pour through the cracks in the roof and 
  land directly on me.&nbsp; I had just come in from the gun pit after a four-hour 
  stint on duty, and I had my rifle slung over my shoulder with the barrel 
  facing down so that rain would not enter the barrel.&nbsp; I was looking for a 
  place to sit and finally selected one of the five-gallon water cans that could 
  be easily moved about if needed.&nbsp; My rifle lay across my lap.&nbsp; The weather was 
  overcast, gray, and windy and it was quite cold for that time of the year.&nbsp; We 
  were manning our 40mm gun, not so much in anticipation of seeing enemy planes 
  but more because there was nothing else to do or anywhere else to go besides 
  the lean-to.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">For 
  breakfast, I had picked up a K-ration from the truck to eat.&nbsp; There were some 
  C-rations, and the new 10-in-1 rations, but they required some preparation–at 
  least heating the can–and I was too hungry to wait for that.&nbsp; I cut off the 
  end of the wax-covered box of a K-ration with my pocketknife.&nbsp; I emptied the 
  contents into my hand, putting the small box of cigarettes, the fig bar, and 
  the packet of toilet paper into a pocket of the raincoat.&nbsp; I debated about 
  skipping the K-ration and using up several small chocolate bars I had in 
  another pocket, saved from previous rations.&nbsp; Pulling one out, I looked at it 
  and saw it had evidently laid around in a warehouse someplace where it had 
  melted and then solidified again before I got it.&nbsp; This meant it was no longer 
  chocolate colored but rather a dark yellow.&nbsp; I also knew from previous 
  experience, it would have absolutely no taste.&nbsp; I put it back in my pocket and 
  went back to the ration in hand.&nbsp; I opened the small can and tipped out the 
  piece of cheese shaped like a hockey puck and then opened the small packet of 
  crackers.&nbsp; There always seemed to be more K-rations that contained cheese as 
  the main ingredient than any other kind.&nbsp; According to army regulations, there 
  was supposed to be a breakfast, dinner, and supper variety for each day’s 
  ration but like everything else in the Army that never went according to plan, 
  this seldom happened.&nbsp; It was not unusual to have three cheese rations for one 
  day instead of three different varieties.&nbsp; It took a lot of trading and a good 
  amount of salesmanship with fellow crewmembers as you tried to get a balanced 
  menu.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">For 
  a drink, I poured the lemon-flavored powder from the little paper packet that 
  came with the ration into my aluminum mess cup.&nbsp; I stood up from the water can 
  I was sitting on, lifted the cover latch, tipped the can until the aluminum 
  cup was nearly full, and stirred the brew with my finger.&nbsp; The water was so 
  chlorinated not even the strong taste of the lemon powder could overcome the 
  medicinal taste.&nbsp; The metal taste of the cup did not help.&nbsp; A hot drink would 
  have tasted a lot better on this chilly morning.&nbsp; The drink resembled lemonade 
  only in its yellow color. The only other drink we had with K-rations was 
  powered coffee.&nbsp; It required hot water and Stevens was starting to build a 
  fire to heat some water in an old ammunition can for himself, Bapst, and 
  anyone else who could drink that stuff.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  lean-to had a strong barnyard smell to it, although there were no livestock in 
  sight.&nbsp; The objectionable smell did not help my appetite for food, although it 
  would have taken more than fresh air to make any real difference.&nbsp; The farmer 
  was losing part of his barn as Stevens was using an ax to chop away at the 
  adjoining wall of the lean-to for dry firewood.&nbsp; Bapst pulled a pinch of 
  coarse-grained chewed tobacco out of his crumpled bag of Granger and deposited 
  it in his mouth.&nbsp; The bulge in his left cheek from a tobacco mound was an 
  ever-present sight.&nbsp; He was using an empty C-ration can for a spittoon, a 
  procedure I had seen him follow hundreds of times before.&nbsp; It seemed so 
  inconsistent to have one crew member tearing part of our makeshift shelter 
  down with an ax and the other one taking steps to assure the mud floor of the 
  shed was not befouled with tobacco juice.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I 
  could see Bapst was in his usual good mood even though there did not seem to 
  be anything to be cheerful about.&nbsp; His easygoing manner and happy disposition 
  made any duty or idle hours spent with him seem enjoyable.&nbsp; His quick wit and 
  jabbing comments about our living conditions or the duty we were performing 
  seemed to be right on target.&nbsp; He could describe something that was the usual 
  subject of complaints and twist it into the most ludicrous dialogue.&nbsp; This 
  morning he was dispensing one of his exaggerated tales of his life as a 
  civilian.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  “This place reminds me a lot of the Chez Paree nightclub in Chicago,” he said 
  with a straight face.&nbsp; “You know, take away the long lines to get in, the 
  long-legged chorus girls, the fancy setting, the dirty comedian, the rude 
  waiters, the washroom attendant glaring at his tip, the padded bill, and there 
  is a lot of similarity.”</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Stevens had stopped his chopping and was looking at him with his mouth agape.&nbsp; 
  “You been there often?” he asked.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  “Only on Saturday nights.” Bapst replied.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Trying to get into the act, I commented, “You forgot the food, Bapst.&nbsp; I’ll 
  bet they don’t have cheese like this,” as I held up the half-eaten hockey 
  puck.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  “Sure they do, only they give it a French name and charge ten bucks for it,” 
  he replied.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  conversation ended there, and Stevens went back to chopping at the farmer’s 
  barn while Bapst kept making contributions to the C-ration can.&nbsp; I was back to 
  my own thoughts, and the foul weather wasn’t helping keep them on a positive 
  track.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b>Lamenting
  What Could Have Been</b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">As I 
  sat there on that gloomy morning downing my K-ration that ran from tasteless 
  (the cheese), to bad tasting (the lemonade), to stale (the crackers), I 
  wondered, what trick of fate had put me here.&nbsp; Wasn’t I supposed to be in a 
  nice comfortable Air Force barracks at an air base in England?&nbsp; And after a 
  good night’s sleep in a comfortable bed I would head over to have a nice hot 
  breakfast of eggs and bacon.&nbsp; Later, I would be briefed on flying bombing 
  missions over Germany.&nbsp; The fact that many planes and their crews did not 
  return from these missions on a regular basis did not occur to me.&nbsp; I was 
  still looking at the Air Force as a branch of the service that was all glamour 
  and excitement with no thought of the downside.&nbsp; My thoughts this day were 
  just one of the many times I indulged in self-pity.&nbsp; The boredom of sitting 
  around places like this with nothing to do was starting to really get to me.&nbsp; 
  Eating my unheated meal on that chilly and rainy morning wasn’t helping my 
  morale.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I 
  thought about what it would be like to be back home again with my friends and 
  family after the war was over.&nbsp; Reflections of home had been rare since we 
  arrived in the ETO so this was an anomaly.&nbsp; There would be home-cooked meals, 
  beer blasts with my buddies, prime rib cut fresh from the standing roast for 
  late sandwiches at the Kickapoo Tavern, and lots of dates with the 
  neighborhood girls.&nbsp; If I had thought it out properly, I would have been happy 
  I was not standing in a foxhole as part of an infantry unit, waiting for the 
  Germans to attack or, worse yet, listening to some lieutenant yelling, “Let’s 
  move it out, men!”&nbsp; But, when you dream about what you could be doing, you 
  think about what good things you want for yourself, not what bad things that 
  are also available.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  After finishing the K-ration, I headed out to the gun pit, but the rain was 
  now coming down harder so I moved for the shelter of the truck instead.&nbsp; But 
  it was not just the rain that had diverted me away from the gun pit.&nbsp; As I 
  approached, the scene was as somber as a funeral.&nbsp; The four men on duty were 
  all wearing their rain gear.&nbsp; The wetness glistened off their helmets and 
  raincoats.&nbsp; There was a surreal look about the scene, which was as static as a 
  war monument in some national park.&nbsp; Spearing and Thomas were sitting on the 
  tracker seats while Dillon and Wellington were standing down in the gun pit, 
  leaning against the side.&nbsp; No one was talking, nor were they looking up at the 
  sky.&nbsp; The ground had turned to mud, and it had been tracked on the gun, the 
  sandbags, and every place else.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  setting brought to mind something I had seen in the Army’s newspaper <i>Stars 
  and </i>Stripe about a month earlier<i>.&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;It was a cartoon by Bill 
  Mauldin named, <i>Willie and</i> <i>Joe</i> depicting two funny but sometimes 
  contemptuous enlisted men who were coping with the rugged life of the Army 
  (See Fig. 120).&nbsp; Mauldin was a GI who saw beyond the horror of war to depict 
  the humor that was ever present amid the daily grind of the average dogface.&nbsp; 
  While his cartoons were about infantrymen, every enlisted man who ever put on 
  a uniform could relate to the irony of the subject.&nbsp; He described with simple 
  strokes of his artistic pen the stupidity, boredom, inequality, and rigorous 
  living conditions that were often so preposterous they became humorous.&nbsp; His 
  cutting depiction of military authority caused General Patton to chastise him 
  personally.&nbsp; Fortunately for Mauldin, General Eisenhower saw in his work a 
  morale booster that needed to be continued</span>.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Nobody looked up as I approached the gun pit that morning and it was obvious 
  the crewmembers were all absorbed with their own somber thoughts just like I 
  had been over in the lean-to.&nbsp; It was not the place where I was going to get 
  any cheer, or even conversation, so I figured it would be better to try and 
  get some sleep in the truck.&nbsp; Climbing on board, I removed my mud covered 
  rubber boots and maneuvered around several reclining crewmembers until I found 
  an area that could be used for a bed.&nbsp; I lay down next to Steve, the ex-POW, 
  who had been out in the rain earlier.&nbsp; I could not see him too well because of 
  the semi-darkness in the truck, but I sure could smell him.&nbsp; Because he had no 
  raincoat, his wet wool uniform had a strong musty smell.&nbsp; After adjusting to 
  the odor, my mind started running toward thoughts of food because I was still 
  very hungry.&nbsp; I tried to put it out of my mind and then I thought about the 
  chocolate bars in my pocket.&nbsp; I opened one and ate it.&nbsp; To some extent, it did 
  satisfy my hunger and I didn’t notice its lack of taste.&nbsp; It is amazing how 
  the human spirit can adjust to adverse conditions.&nbsp; What is it that they say 
  about the postman?&nbsp; Neither rain nor snow, etc.&nbsp; In my case, neither rain, nor 
  smell nor tasteless food can keep me from satisfying my hunger with a candy 
  bar.&nbsp; The rain was making a lot of noise as it bounced off the tarpaulin 
  covering the truck so it was impossible to fall asleep.&nbsp; It was too dark in 
  there to read and, like the men I had just seen over at the gun pit, none of 
  us were in the mood to talk.&nbsp; So, I lay there thinking nothing in particular 
  but occasionally lamenting my situation until the rain let up and I finally 
  fell asleep.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Later that day, I was back at the gun pit taking another turn at manning my 
  position.&nbsp; The weather cleared, and we spotted six planes going overhead at a 
  very high altitude.&nbsp; We went on alert and began tracking them.&nbsp; Even with 
  binoculars, it was difficult to make a positive identification what type of 
  planes they were.&nbsp; At first, we thought they were German JU-88s but we finally 
  decided they were British Mosquitoes (See Fig. 121).&nbsp; Both were medium 
  twin-engine bombers.&nbsp; We were very disappointed we did not have a target to 
  shoot at.&nbsp; When we were having trouble making identification of the planes, 
  some of the crewmembers wanted to fire at them without knowing their true 
  identity.&nbsp; They were getting desperate to find a target to shoot at and even 
  friendly aircraft were starting to look like potential possibilities.&nbsp; 
  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img border="0" alt="British Mosquito Airplane" src ="images/British_Mosquito_20_121.jpg" width=550 height=265 ></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">My 
  disposition became much more cheerful as the day wore on.&nbsp; Maybe it was the 
  sunny weather or just a change in thinking that improved my outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 
  whole, my periods of despondency lamentation about what might have been were 
  infrequent and of short duration especially, at this stage of the war. What I 
  had seen in Europe had given me a new yardstick with which to measure my own 
  condition.&nbsp; Compared to a lot of the other GIs I had seen and certainly 
  compared to the German civilians, things could be a lot worse than what I had 
  going for me.&nbsp; Standing around in a gun pit in the middle of a farm field was 
  terribly boring but it wasn’t dangerous or even hard work.&nbsp; The other 
  crewmembers seemed to come out of their dejected mood also, and they began to 
  needle Le Claire about his French heritage.&nbsp; This was a sure sign we were all 
  getting back into a better mood.&nbsp; Those doing the needling knew it would not 
  be long before they would be the ones on the receiving end.&nbsp; Making fun of one 
  another was one of our favorite pastimes and it usually produced some of our 
  best laughs.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b>More
  German POWs</b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  following evening at dusk, a lone Army truck stopped on the road near us, and 
  the driver signaled for us to come over to him.&nbsp; Bernal and I walked over.&nbsp; 
  The driver was one of the black truck drivers assigned to the Red Ball 
  Express.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; This was a unit of mostly black soldiers (They were 
  called Negroes at the time.) that delivered troops, supplies, food, gasoline, 
  and munitions, to the frontline troops.&nbsp; The drivers were assigned to the 
  Quartermaster and Transportation Corps, and they drove like wild men to get 
  their supplies through.&nbsp; Their insignia was a three-foot diameter red ball 
  painted on each side of the truck cab.&nbsp; The rest of the truck was painted an 
  OD color like every other piece of equipment in the Army.&nbsp; The Military Police 
  and everyone else were instructed these trucks had top priority and were to be 
  given preference over any other kind of vehicle, including armament.&nbsp; From my 
  observation of these drivers, they did not have to be given preference over 
  others - they took it.&nbsp; Their driving, which was somewhere between reckless 
  and crazy, was already somewhat of a legend in the European Theater.&nbsp; The 
  rumor was General Patton thought they were doing a great job despite their 
  excessive speed, and nobody was about to argue.&nbsp; After these trucks made their 
  delivery of supplies to the frontline troops, they were used to haul German 
  prisoners who had recently been captured, back to POW camps.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  That’s what the soldier who called us over had in his truck - about a hundred 
  prisoners who were all standing up.&nbsp; At this stage of the war, the American 
  Army was taking prisoners by the hundreds of thousands (See Fig. 122).</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img border="0" alt="German prisoners on Autobahn" src ="images/German_prisoners_on_Autobahn_20_122.jpg" width=439 height=545 ></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  The 
  men on the truck were very young, and we guessed their ages to be in the 
  midteens.&nbsp; Everyone on board was packed in tight, and the ones around the 
  edges were leaning out over the side railing, which was about waist high, to 
  get a little more breathing room.&nbsp; We had seen some over packed human cargo in 
  Alzey but this was the topper.&nbsp; The prisoners all looked tired, uncomfortable, 
  and ornery; the driver looked scared.&nbsp; We could see into the cab of his truck 
  and<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="M-6 Machine Gun" vspace="8" src="images/M-6_Machine_Gun_20_123.jpg" width="400" align="right" height="197"> he was alone.&nbsp; There was an M-3 machine gun mounted up behind his head at 
  the back of the cab with its collapsible wire stock folded up alongside the 
  barrel (See Fig. 123).&nbsp; This weapon was called a grease gun because that’s 
  what it looked like.&nbsp; It was relatively small and, in my view, an 
  unimpressive-looking weapon, although its looks were somewhat deceiving.&nbsp; It 
  was made from stamped-out metal parts that gave it a somewhat tinny look even 
  though it was a .45-caliber machine gun with the same firepower as the 
  Thompson machine gun with its thirty-round clip.&nbsp; The driver told us he had 
  been loaded up in some small town and was sent back alone with only vague 
  directions as to where the nearest POW pen was located.&nbsp; The word pen was new 
  to us.&nbsp; At this point in the war, the Americans were taking so many prisoners 
  they did not have regular camps to put them in.&nbsp; They would find an open 
  field, put up guards on all sides, and herd the POWs into the area they called 
  pens (See Fig. 124).</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img border="0" alt="German prisoners held in pens" src ="images/German_POWs_holding_pen_20_124.jpg" width=500 height=397 ></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  driver had been on the road for hours and was completely lost. While his 
  objective was the nearest POW pen, at this stage he would have been satisfied 
  with finding anyone who would take the load off of his hands.&nbsp; We told him we 
  had no idea where the nearest one was, but we had seen a CP back down the road 
  from where he came, and we directed him to it.&nbsp; We probably would have told 
  him anything to get him out of our area.&nbsp; He made a U-turn with the truck and 
  got stuck in the ditch, but was finally able to pull out of it.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">As 
  the truck lurched out of the ditch, the cargo swayed.&nbsp; The prisoners at the 
  back of the truck were only protected from falling out by the truck’s 
  tailgate, which barely reached as high as their knees.&nbsp; They were holding on 
  to those who were standing deeper in the truck so any sudden movement made 
  most of the cargo move in unison.&nbsp; For a minute it looked like we were going 
  to have the POWs spilled all over the roadway.&nbsp; However, they managed to 
  recover, and the truck proceeded on its way.&nbsp; The Germans were now in an open 
  grumble.&nbsp; If you could detect what someone was saying in a foreign tongue by 
  his facial expression and tone of voice, profanity was the subject at the 
  moment.&nbsp; The words that we did understand were </span><i>
  <span lang="DE-AT" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">dummkopf</span></i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> 
  and </span><i><span lang="DE-AT" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">schweinhund</span></i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">.&nbsp; 
  The sun was fading fast.&nbsp; The driver gave us one last look when he pulled away 
  with an expression consistent with that of a cornered man.&nbsp; We </span>were<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> 
  glad when he drove off.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I 
  had a twinge of guilt at seeing that last look of desperation by the driver 
  but it was not enough to signal him to return.&nbsp; I tried to put it out of my 
  mind by convincing myself that our gun crew had no facility to guard and 
  possibly feed that many men.&nbsp; Joe and I watched the truck pick up speed as it 
  headed down the road. As the truck made a bend in the road, there was another 
  swaying of the POWs because the truck was now up to a reckless speed.&nbsp; The 
  driver was in complete compliance with the lore of the Red Ball Express.&nbsp; 
  Speed was their forte.&nbsp; In this case, however, panic may have had more to do 
  with it than a desire to retain the division’s reputation.&nbsp; We headed back to 
  the gun pit and neither Joe nor I talked because we each knew what the other 
  was thinking.&nbsp; Any feeling of guilt about the way we handled the situation 
  soon faded.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  next day, Steve finally convinced us we should give him a gun.&nbsp; We had a 
  bolt-action German Mauser K.98 rifle we had picked up someplace along the way, 
  so we gave it to him, along with a couple of clips of ammunition.&nbsp; We did not 
  have to show him how to use it; he knew.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Later that day we observed two youths, about twelve or thirteen years old, 
  coming along the road near our gun position.&nbsp; They were riding bicycles, which 
  were scarce but not unseen in Germany.&nbsp; The thing that happened next explained 
  why they were scarce.&nbsp; As we watched the bikers, two men about thirty years 
  old stopped the bikes and knocked the riders off.&nbsp; The men then got on and 
  started to ride off.&nbsp; Steve said the two men were Russian slave laborers, but 
  we had no idea how he knew.&nbsp; They were wearing the same nondescript clothes 
  most civilians wore.&nbsp; We had not seen any Russians up to that time, but then 
  again, if we had we probably would not have recognized them as such.&nbsp; It was 
  not easy to tell one nationality from another.&nbsp; However, it was unusual to see 
  two able-bodied men of that age in civilian clothes at that time in Germany, 
  especially in a rural area. As they drove off, Steve cocked his gun and took 
  aim at them.&nbsp; (The Russians had also invaded Poland in 1939 along with the 
  Germans.)&nbsp; We immediately yanked the gun away from him.&nbsp; Evidently, he hated 
  Russians just a little bit more than Germans.&nbsp; Our thoughts about the incident 
  ran something like this: the stealing of the bike was a non-event.&nbsp; Who cared 
  if the Germans and Russians were fighting?&nbsp; However, the Russians were our 
  allies, and we didn’t condone having them shot in the back over a bicycle.&nbsp; If 
  they were taking vengeance for the way they had been treated in a slave labor 
  or prison of war camp, they probably had a good reason to do so.&nbsp; Finally, 
  Steve convinced us to give him back the rifle.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  next morning Steve asked us if we wanted eggs for breakfast.&nbsp; We hadn’t seen a 
  fresh egg or even a chicken since we arrived in Europe.&nbsp; We said, “Yes,” and 
  he took off down the road, carrying a steel helmet by the chinstrap in one 
  hand and the rifle in the other.&nbsp; About half an hour later, he returned with 
  the helmet full of eggs.&nbsp; We couldn’t believe our eyes.&nbsp; Steve said the German 
  civilians kept chickens in their attics in this rural area so they wouldn’t be 
  stolen.&nbsp; He had just marched into their houses and gone up to the attics.&nbsp; 
  With the rifle he met no resistance, or did he?&nbsp; We scrambled the eggs, 
  cooking them in an empty can and then divided them among the crew.&nbsp; They 
  tasted very good and we even had some salt packets left over from some rations 
  to season them.&nbsp; When Steve asked if we wanted some chickens and possibly a 
  piglet, we decided it was time to take the gun back from him, and we did.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b>German
  Civilians Seek Information</b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
  got the word to March Order, so we started to pack up.&nbsp; As we did, half a 
  dozen civilians, all women, arrived to talk to us.&nbsp; They were curious to know 
  what was really happening in the war.&nbsp; They were getting nothing but 
  propaganda from their leaders.&nbsp; In fact, we didn’t know much more than they 
  did, except the Third Army, of which we were part, was advancing deeper into 
  Germany.&nbsp; One of the women said, “I have a cousin who lives in St. Louis.”&nbsp; 
  Nobody commented so she continued, “Do any of you live near there?”&nbsp; Again 
  there was silence as we were not interested in answering questions.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  women began hinting around about where we were going but did not have the 
  nerve to ask us directly.&nbsp; Bapst picked up on this, and he pointed northeast 
  as he said, “The next stop is Berlin.”&nbsp; Several of them frowned but they said 
  nothing.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  <img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Joe Wellington" vspace="8" src="images/Joe_Wellington_20_125.jpg" width="200" align="left" height="257">
  Wellington (See Fig. 125), who could be a wise guy at times, told them, <i>“</i></span><i><span lang="DE" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Ruskie 
  soldaten </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Kommen ins </span>
  <span lang="DE" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">morgen</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">.”</span></i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp; 
  (Russian soldiers are coming in the morning.}&nbsp; This was an expression he had 
  picked up from Steve who liked to torment the German people by blurting it out 
  frequently.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  civilians responded with <i>“Nein! Nein! Nein!”</i>&nbsp; They had fear in their 
  voices and their expressions showed near panic.&nbsp; They really hated the 
  Russians and were scared to death how they would be treated by the uncivilized 
  Bolsheviks from the East.&nbsp; The women also asked us if we were going to fight 
  the Russians when we met up with them.&nbsp; Their propaganda leaders had told them 
  we would attack Russia (actually, they had been told American and German 
  armies would join forces to do so), and they were surprised when we told them 
  we wouldn’t.&nbsp; We had heard rumors about a possible confrontation with the 
  Russians after the German war, but we did not dwell on the subject because it 
  did not sound plausible to us.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  people of Germany must have been very disillusioned with the war at this 
  stage.&nbsp; While their Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, was still feeding 
  them a steady diet of lies, what was really happening must have been all too 
  obvious even to these women in a farming community.&nbsp; Their returning service 
  men, usually casualties, told them what was really occurring on the 
  battlefields, and that the German army was in full retreat on all fronts.&nbsp; The 
  early phase of the Battle of the Bulge a few months earlier had given the 
  Germans, government leaders and civilians alike, a short-lived spurt of 
  optimism.&nbsp; Now, in addition to the invading army, they could observe the same 
  view up in the sky as we could.&nbsp; Almost on a daily basis, there were hundreds, 
  or perhaps thousands, of Allied planes heading in or returning from bombing 
  runs on German cities.&nbsp; These sights, along with the suffering and casualties 
  they were experiencing, made for a very depressed civilian population.&nbsp; You 
  could see it in the faces of these women and in their conversations, which 
  Steve interpreted.&nbsp; Even the remote possibility of the Russians turning up in 
  their area created a new level of fear for these people.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
  wondered what had changed to make these German civilians speak with us. Were 
  they no longer afraid of their government, who, at this stage of the war, was 
  urging the civilian population to rise up against the invading armies?&nbsp; Up 
  until this stop in Hanau, the adult German people would barely look at us, 
  much less talk.&nbsp; Was the war taking some kind of a turn, coming to an end?&nbsp; 
  Had their radio and information services been destroyed, and had they nothing 
  else available to them?&nbsp; Did being in a rural area make a difference?&nbsp; We 
  never found the answers to any of these questions, but it really wasn’t 
  important to us.&nbsp; We thought no more about it.&nbsp; Those were their problems, not 
  ours.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
  joined our battalion’s convoy and headed southeast.&nbsp; We hoped our next gun 
  emplacement would involve the defense of something more challenging than a 
  farmer’s field.&nbsp; One thing was sure: we would not know where we were going 
  until we got there, and our purpose in being there would probably never be 
  known.&nbsp; Maybe this lack of information should have bothered us more than it 
  did.&nbsp; In reality, we made jokes among ourselves about the situation.&nbsp; The long 
  period of training in the States and the time overseas had dulled our senses.&nbsp; 
  We just did what we were told and went where we were sent.&nbsp; Our anxiety list 
  included more mundane subjects like when we would get our next hot meal, when 
  we would get a shower, and when would the mail from home finally catch up to 
  us.&nbsp; We hadn’t had mail for nearly a month.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">As 
  we drove along in the convoy, several of our crew members were still pursuing 
  the subject of who was making the decision about where we were to go next, 
  what were we to guard and how long we would stay at any given site.&nbsp; 
  Certainly, it wasn’t Captain McKee!</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  first evening in convoy, we stopped on the outskirts of some town and 
  bivouacked for the night.&nbsp; Despite our pledge not to ask headquarters any more 
  questions, some of us had become obsessed with this decision matter and 
  decided to pursue it.&nbsp; We took the subterfuge method of quizzing the officers’ 
  Jeep drivers (we called them dog robbers).&nbsp; They liked to dispense information 
  on the QT they had overheard from listening to the officers talk because it 
  gave them a feeling of importance.&nbsp; Their job was looked down on to a certain 
  degree by the other enlisted men because of their relationship with the brass 
  so this was their way to be one of the boys.&nbsp; Sophie, Lt. Engler’s driver, 
  walked by our truck and we quizzed him about who was making the decisions for 
  the battalion, and for D-Battery in particular.&nbsp; We had expected him to still 
  be upset about the artillery firing back at St. Goar, but he did not seem so.&nbsp; 
  His arm had healed, and I don’t think he and the others who were with him at 
  the time ever knew they had been set up.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Before getting to the subject of who determined where the gun sites were to be 
  located at each new location, there were a lot of disparaging remarks about 
  Captain McKee.&nbsp; We were surprised–maybe shocked would be a better word–about 
  Sophie’s opinion of the officers.&nbsp; He took off on a long tirade blasting our 
  opinions of our leaders.&nbsp; He did not agree with our low feelings about Captain 
  McKee, but neither did he have anything specific to offer in his defense.&nbsp; 
  Some of our crew were disappointed because they did not want to hear anything 
  favorable about McKee.&nbsp; Sophie was surprised at our feelings about Lt. Kraft, 
  but he did not know the details of the disastrous scouting episode along the 
  Rhine River.&nbsp; We did not have time to explain it all to him so we each held to 
  our own opinions.&nbsp; Sophie said that Lt. Engler was a great guy, but McKee kept 
  him on a short chain and, therefore, Engler had little to say about what was 
  going on.&nbsp; We concluded McKee didn’t like Engler because he was popular with 
  the enlisted men.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Sophie told us all decisions regarding sites to be protected and even most gun 
  locations came down from the Battalion Headquarters.&nbsp; The men in that unit 
  scouted new places, and the colonel in charge of our 815<sup>th</sup> 
  Battalion laid out a specific area for the guns of each battery.&nbsp; The colonel 
  in charge of our battalion was a West Point Academy graduate, but we had not 
  seen him since we left the States.&nbsp; We often wondered what screw-up he had 
  made to get stuck with an antiaircraft outfit when there were so many more 
  important jobs in the Army.&nbsp; The idea of all decisions coming from the top did 
  not seem logical, but being illogical made them easier to believe.&nbsp; Most 
  things in the Army were done in opposition to what logic would dictate.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">That 
  night some men slept on the truck, while others of us lay on the shoulder of 
  the road to sleep in our bedrolls.&nbsp; The weather was mild and the stars were 
  out in force.&nbsp; Everyone was up at daybreak as we started packing up in 
  preparation to move out.&nbsp; Our crew was already on board when Sergeant Kornich 
  came down the line.&nbsp; “We’re going to have a little church service,” he 
  announced,&nbsp; “Everybody off the trucks.”</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  “What the hell’s he talking about?&nbsp; It’s not even Sunday,” mumbled Grimes.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">When 
  we assembled, Engler told us this idea had come from on top, whatever that 
  meant.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">“You 
  mean from heaven?” quipped Le Claire.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
  expected to have the chaplain officiate but we did not see him.&nbsp; Someone had 
  decided each platoon would do their own thing so gun sections one through four 
  gathered in one spot.&nbsp; Lieutenant Engler was to lead the service while 
  Sergeant Kornich stood beside him.&nbsp; Because there were men from different 
  religions, he tried to make it as ecumenical as possible.&nbsp; He told us to 
  remove our helmets, bow our heads, and pray in our own way for a few minutes.&nbsp; 
  As we were doing that, Engler began reciting the Lord’s Prayer.&nbsp; “Our Father, 
  who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name….” and then he stopped.&nbsp; Kornich 
  coached him and he continued.&nbsp; “Thy kingdom come…” and again he stopped.&nbsp; Then 
  Kornich took over and finished the prayer.&nbsp; Evidently, it had been a long time 
  since Engler had done any praying.&nbsp; We all just stood there for an 
  embarrassing few minutes until Kornich ordered us back on the trucks.&nbsp; “Load 
  up!” he yelled and you could detect a tone of disgust in his voice.&nbsp; It would 
  be our last impromptu prayer service.&nbsp; That one had been a disaster.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We 
  boarded our trucks, formed into a new convoy and took off for places unknown.&nbsp; 
  Steve was kept well hidden from the opening at the back end, and his aromatic 
  uniform caused most of the rest of us to sit near the opening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Breakfast and 
  lunch were served on board.&nbsp; They consisted of K-rations and heavily 
  chlorinated water drunk out of our canteens.&nbsp; The boxes, wrappers, and cans 
  from the rations were thrown out the opening at the rear of the truck as we 
  finished with them.&nbsp; Germany looked so bad, we considered it one big garbage 
  dump and no effort was made on our part to improve it.&nbsp; As time went on, our 
  living conditions and personal habits were becoming more like those of a band 
  of gypsies.</span></p>
