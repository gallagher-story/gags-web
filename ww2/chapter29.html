    people have decided to agree upon.<br>

</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Army had set up technical schools to keep
    the GIs busy while they were still in Europe. Joe Bernal and I signed up for
    a course in aircraft engine maintenance being held in Blackpool, England.
    Neither of us had any special interest in the subject, but we figured it was
    a good way to see Britain again.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After being accepted, we took a train to the
    port of Le Havre, where we first landed in Europe. There, we were to catch a
    boat over to England. The train ride was absolutely the worst ride of my
    life. Because the Allied air forces had shot up most of the trains in
    Europe, they were resorting to using anything that was available for
    service. We were assigned to a World War I era train, with cars that were
    called forty and eight's (quarante hommes et huit cheveaux). This meant it
    was designed to carry forty troops and eight horses, or mules, during that
    war (See Fig. 173b). The windows were small slits along the sides.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Boxcar_Train_for_Troops_29_173b.jpg" width="650" height="404"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were no electric
    lights and the tiny windows let in a minimum amount of light. For the early
    part of the trip, we left the boxcar-like doors slightly open for light even
    though it was the middle of winter. There was no heat, so we finally closed
    the doors and sat in the semi-darkness. We sat on the floor with our backs
    against the wall and the position soon became very uncomfortable. Some men
    were sprawled out on the floor, using their duffel bags for pillows. Some
    GIs at one end of our car started a fire to keep warm and later had to go
    around to find men who had canteens of drinking water to douse the burning
    floor so the car did not burn down. The train stopped for some reason about
    midway in the trip so Joe and I got out and walked back to a boxcar, several
    cars behind us, where some GIs were riding. They told us they had a potbelly
    stove going in their car so we climbed in and spent the rest of the trip
    there huddled around it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we arrived in Le Havre, we pulled into a
    railroad yard, and someone opened one of the car doors. Spread out in front
    of us as far as we could see were thousands of German prisoners of war all
    chattering in German. They had just arrived from America by boat and were
    being repatriated to their native country. I wondered if they knew what they
    were getting into in that land of total annihilation. While we were not
    afraid of them, we felt quite uncomfortable because of their great number.
    They all looked so healthy and well fed, not at all like some of the
    American prisoners of war we had seen who had suffered under German
    imprisonment. They began to hit us up for cigarettes, so we closed the door
    and locked it until we pulled into the station.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We took a boat across the channel and then a
    train to Blackpool, England, on the west coast. The school was named Warton
    American Technical School. The classroom soon became a secondary assignment.
    Our main objective was to see the sights of England and Scotland, so we
    spent most of our time planning a trip or recovering from one. No one in the
    class ever intended to be an aircraft mechanic. Even if they did, it would
    have been tough competing for jobs against the tens of thousands of GIs who
    had just spent the last three or four years at that occupation in the Army
    Air Force. I really felt sorry for our civilian instructor at the school,
    who was trying to teach something to a bunch of students who, he knew, were
    not ever going to benefit from his course and could care less about the
    subject.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The resort town of Blackpool had many pubs
    and other interesting places to visit. It was a good location to spend our
    weekday evenings. There was a large dance pavilion, although it seemed to
    cater more to an older crowd of the local people. Every Friday at noon, we
    would take off for Edinburgh, Glasgow, or London. One of the Army rumors we
    had heard before leaving Antwerp was that the girls in England were making a
    last and desperate effort to snag, like in marry, a GI. The rumor said many
    of the girls who had married GIs earlier were writing home to tell the ones
    remaining how great America was. That, plus the fact the population of GIs
    in England had greatly thinned out, made the girls desperate. Supposedly,
    they would bump into GIs on the street, buy them drinks in the pub, and go
    to other desperate measures to get acquainted. Like most other Army rumors,
    this one proved to be wrong. Despite the rumor, we had a great time in
    England.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of the course, we got our grades.
    Most of them were good which was like getting a D in a civilian school. The
    Army had about ten grades, with most of them being Excellent, Superior, Very
    Superior, etc. Nobody ever flunks a course in the Army but we came close to
    it. We all tore up our diplomas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When Joe and I got back to Antwerp, we
    realized we had miscalculated determining when we would be eligible to
    return home. Many of the men we had been with throughout our time in the
    service had already been shipped back to the States (See Fig. 174). New men
    we had never met were being transferred into our unit, which was now known
    as the 797th Military Police Battalion. We continued to do MP duty while we
    made every effort to get our names on top of the list of those being
    returned to the States.
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="GIs going home" src ="images/GIs_going_home_29_174.jpg" width=500 height=360 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One evening when I had just returned from a
    movie, I entered the long narrow room in the converted diamond factory where
    I bunked with about forty other men. The place was in bedlam as everyone was
    shouting at one individual. You could not have stirred up the occupants
    greater if you had unleashed a Bengal Tiger in the room.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"You dirty bastard. You didn't."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"That's taking revenge too far."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"If he finds out about this, you had
    better walk around back home with a loaded gun all the rest of your
    life."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"I've heard about bad guys but you're
    the worst."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Tell me you're kidding."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One man was pounding his fist against the
    wall. "You didn't. Tell me you didn't"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">These were just a few of the things being
    said in a loud and forceful manner. Despite all of the negative rhetoric,
    there was something missing from the disparaging comments: there was no
    malice in them. It was as if they were saying, "You've done something
    that I wouldn't have done in a million years, but after I recover from this
    initial shock, it will be easier to comprehend."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When I got filled in on the details, I
    understood what all of the commotion was about. It seems as though the
    battery clerk had gone on furlough and the GI being chastised took his place
    for a week. Part of the clerk's duty was to pass out the mail from home and
    to get letters from the men in the battery over to the Army post office. The
    permanent clerk had shown the new man a stack of mail on top of the mail bin
    that was to have special handling. It contained letters from women in
    England and Continental Europe that had been sent to married men already on
    their way back to the States. The assumption was there had been some kind of
    romance between them. Under no circumstances was it to be forward on to the
    men's homes, and the temporary clerk was to keep his eyes out for anything
    new. The permanent clerk had been keeping the letters as an easy way to
    identify future mail of the same type.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It seems the temporary clerk had a special
    grudge against an officer who had caught him fraternizing with a German
    girl. In this case, the man had lost the
    sergeant stripes he had worked hard to get. We heard he had been brooding
    about it for many months. He took the letters on the bin from some girl in
    England that were addressed to this officer, put them in an envelope,
    addressed it to the officer's wife, and then took it over to the Camp Tophat
    post office to mail. This GI was single, and he made a point of telling us
    he did not understand why it was all right for a married man to be involved
    with another woman while a single man like him could not even talk with a
    single woman. Despite the fact the no fraternization law was Army policy, he
    tried to convince us, it was a moral issue. Most of us were not convinced of
    the man's moral view and considered his act plain old revenge. The GI took a
    lot of flak that day, and he became the center of a story told throughout
    what was left of our battalion. Men would point him out to their friends
    after they explained what he did with the comment, "That's him."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a strong push by the Army to get
    men to reenlist. Evidently, so many were being discharged the government was
    afraid of not having enough left to handle the occupation of conquered
    countries. Also, there were rumblings from Russia that made government and
    military leaders uncomfortable, and they wanted to have a sizable armed
    force available to oppose the Russians. For a fifteen-month reenlistment, we
    would receive a three-month furlough at home, a three hundred dollar cash
    bonus, and a guarantee we would hold our existing rank and never be less
    than a private first class. Some men took them up on it, but I had no
    interest in the plan. I could not wait to get out of the Army.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Even though many men from our battalion were
    leaving, there was no remorse separating from fellows I ate, slept,
    traveled, fought, marched, laughed, complained, and labored with for the
    past two and a half years. Although some of them could now be considered
    good friends, we had always known there was something temporary about the
    friendship. Even though I knew I would probably never see most of them
    again, my thoughts were not about leaving these friends. I was thinking
    about getting home and seeing my family, relatives, and longtime friends I
    had known before the war. In this unusual situation, it was not the leaving
    that occupied my mind but, rather, the anticipation of what was to come in
    the future with renewed acquaintances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Trip Back To The States</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I pulled a little more MP duty before I got
    the word in late February, 1946, that I was going home. While I had come
    over on one of the world's largest passenger ships, I went back on one that
    was less than one-half its size. The name of the ship was SS Sea Scamp (See
    Figs. 175a and 175b), and it was built in the United States by Ingalls Ship Building.
    It was known by the United States Maritime Commission as a C3 Type ship. Its
    statistics were sixteen-thousand tons, four-hundred-sixty-five feet long,
    seventy feet wide, with a top speed of eighteen knots. We commented with a
    name like Sea Scamp, they must have produced so many ships during the war
    they were scraping the bottom of the barrel for a name. While on board, we
    called it Sea Tramp.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Sea Scamp" src ="images/Sea_Scamp_Ship_29_175a.jpg" width=500 height=303 ></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Sea Scamp" src ="images/Sea_Scamp_Ship_29_175b.jpg" width=450 height=690 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On the return trip, we had a little bit but
    not a lot more room in our quarters, but, of more importance, we had
    American food instead of lousy British chow we'd had on our way over. There
    were no blackout conditions like we had on the way over, and we got a lot of
    time up on deck. The morale on ship was extremely high, and there was always
    someone to make us laugh. Most of the jokes or outlandish stories were at
    the expense of the Army.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were two unusual incidents on board
    that caused quite a bit of commotion. First, they discovered a GI had
    smuggled a dog on board. It did not seem to be such a big thing to us but
    there was some Army captain who was really making an issue of it. He was
    threatening to have the ship returned to Le Havre to discharge the GI and
    the dog. We never did go back, and we assumed the ship's captain did not go
    along with the idea.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A few days later, they discovered a small boy
    who also had been smuggled on board in a duffel bag. He was dressed in a
    tailor-made American lieutenant's uniform. They came around and took up a
    collection for him, and that's the last we heard about him. The discoveries
    produced a lot of remarks by the men on board. "What next: a German
    fraulein?" someone asked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As on the trip over to England, there were
    some black soldiers on board with us, but we were still not mixed with them
    in our living quarters. The armed services would not become integrated for a
    few more years. However, we did mingle together up on deck and we met
    several men whom we got to know quite well. They seemed to be able to
    describe army life better than anyone else and their stories were the
    funniest ever. Two of them had been attached to a Quartermaster unit and
    insisted that they were in the 444th Mess-Kit Repair Battalion. They told of
    all the trials this unit encountered during the war and of how only the
    paratroopers had a harder time of it. We all knew it was made up but it
    produced a lot of laughs as they elaborated on their experiences.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We hit a storm mid ocean, and the small ship
    bobbed around like a cork. There were heavy swells, and at times the ocean
    seemed to be thirty or forty feet higher than the ship's deck. The crew
    finally closed up all the hatches to our sleeping quarters to keep us below
    deck. We were given rations to eat because we could not get to the mess
    without going outside. Fortunately, the storm only lasted about twenty-four
    hours and most of us rode through it with only minor seasickness. Some of
    the GIs on board with us were making a big thing about how bad the storm
    was. Those of us who rode through the extended storm aboard the Nieuw
    Amsterdam on the trip overseas told them they hadn't seen anything.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Arriving In New York City</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived in New York Harbor early in the
    morning on March 4th. This time, I saw the Statue of Liberty and the
    breathtaking view of the skyline as we sailed by. Some of the men who had
    started their military service in New York pointed out landmarks. To all of
    us, it meant a return to our native country and a step closer to our homes.
    Smiles shone from everyone; I had never seen so many happy GIs in one place.
    When we arrived at our dock there was no celebration or welcoming committee
    to greet us. The war had been over long enough all cheering for returning
    soldiers had long faded away.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Walking off the ship was a lot easier than it
    was on our trip over to Europe because the load we carried was so much less.
    We had turned in our rifle, gas mask, helmet, gun belt, bayonet, backpack
    and many other items in Antwerp so the load we carried down the gangplank
    consisted of just one duffel bag. A couple of the men got down and kissed
    the ground. They had seen other GIs do that in newsreels, and they knew it
    would get a big laugh.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We took a train to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey
    for processing (See Figs. 175c &amp; 175d).</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Camp_Kilmer_29_175c.jpg" width="700" height="462"></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Camp_Kilmer_29_175d.jpg" width="700" height="434"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For lunch they served us steak, and it was a big hit for
    everyone. That afternoon we walked over to the large PX there. It was full
    of all the little luxuries that we had not had while in Europe. What a
    thrill it was to just wander through the aisles looking at all the great
    things that were available. Le Claire commented, "Welcome back to
    civilization!" I bought copies of Life, Time and Readers Digest just to
    get up to date on what was happening in the States. Next I went over and had
    a large hot-fudge sundae. One of the new things we had not seen before that
    caught our attention was the ballpoint pen. It had been recently introduced
    for the first time and was displayed in the PX in very ornate packaging. The
    price was eighteen dollars each. This was a sizable sum of money. I watched
    a GI try one out at the counter. He scratched it on a sheet of paper at
    least ten times until it finally made a mark, and then he bought it. While I
    would not have bought that pen, we were all eager to buy things that were
    part of the American culture because we were so glad to be back in the
    States. We treated ourselves to the point of overindulgence on Cokes, candy
    bars, ice cream, and even the PX's 3-2 beer, which now tasted great. We
    wanted to restore that feeling of participating in the routine of buying and
    enjoying the things we had missed while in Europe in any way we could.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We only stayed in New York for a few days
    before taking a train to Chicago. We arrived at Camp Grant, northwest of
    Chicago, where I started my Army career. It was now called a Separation
    Center. The first time we heard that name, one of the GIs I was with said,
    "They mean a Freedom Center, don't they?" The same sterile
    barracks and surroundings were there but they did not seem all that unusual
    to us this time. We had seen many places that looked the same and others
    that were a lot worse. On our first trip there, nearly three years earlier,
    we were filled with nervous anticipation of what we were getting in to. This
    time it was nervous anticipation of a completely different kind. We
    distrusted the Army and there were still some feelings of doubt that would
    not be gone until we had our discharge papers in hand and we were outside
    the camp gate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">They explained to us about the GI Bill of Rights (See Fig.176) and other
    benefits that would be available to us as veterans. The ten-thousand dollar
    life insurance policy we had been given at our induction could be converted
    into a civilian policy that would now require a payment of six dollars and
    fifty cents per month. I was given one-hundred dollars in cash as the first
    installment of the three-hundred dollars in mustering out pay that I would
    receive. The balance of the mustering out money would be mailed to me over
    the next several months. I was also paid four dollars and forty cents in
    travel pay. In keeping with the Army's policy of not telling details, I had
    to assume this travel pay was money to cover the cost of transportation from
    the camp to my home. The lack of particulars did not keep me from accepting
    the piddling amount. Also, I received back pay for the month of February and
    for the seventeen days of March, which brought me up to date. This new
    infusion of cash made me feel rich.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/GI_Bill_of_Rights_29_176.jpg" width="360" height="521"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Just like the Army did in Antwerp, they tried
    to get us to sign up again for another hitch. The new package was to promote
    all members of an antiaircraft crew one rank. That was their way of paying
    them more money in an effort to encourage reenlistment. I thought those who
    signed up were paying quite a price for just one more stripe on their arm
    and a little bit more money. It was surprising to see some of the fellows I
    knew reenlist, including my buddy Jim Grimes. Was this the same guy who sat
    on his bunk and damned the Army on numerous occasions along with the rest of
    us? Had he and the rest of them forgotten so soon? For some reason a
    statement made by a GI from Brooklyn, New York, when we were in Europe,
    "So bad I don't need a job," kept popping up in my mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We turned in all of our army clothing except
    for one uniform to be worn home. Many of the men had army watches,
    compasses, etc., which they did a good job of hiding. We were asked
    individually, "Do you have any article that belongs to the United
    States Government?" You knew when they referred to the Army as the
    United States Government, they meant business, but nothing except a thorough
    search would have produced items the men wanted to keep. It seemed everyone
    I knew had an army watch, and I wondered where I had missed the boat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Discharged !!</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, on March 17, 1946, I was honorably
    discharged from the Army after serving for two years and nine months. After
    having my last lunch in a mess hall, I walked out of the camp with several
    of my friends. We passed a couple of officers heading into the camp. We made
    a point of making eye contact with them and our hands stayed stiff at our
    sides. "Boy! That felt good," I commented. There was a bus leaving
    for Chicago late in the afternoon, but we could not wait to get away from
    anything relating to the Army so several of us hired a taxi that took us
    into downtown Chicago. My parents came and picked me up there and drove me
    home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was a very happy day.</font></p>
