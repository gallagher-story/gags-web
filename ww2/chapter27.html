    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after our outfit was assigned to MP
    duty, I went on what was supposed to be a seven-day furlough (See Fig. 163)
    to Nice, on the French Riviera, for what the Army called R&amp;R (rest and
    relaxation). Five of us went together. The other four were from each of the
    other batteries in our battalion. While we hadn't known each other before
    this time, we soon found we had a lot in common, and the comradery made for
    a very pleasant trip. One fellow, Mel Gurgle, was the sergeant major from
    Headquarters Battery and the aide to the colonel in charge of the 815th
    Battalion. The other three were named Joe, Bill and Russell. We soon learned
    Mel was a master at making wheels turn. Soon after our arrival in Paris,
    where we were to transfer for the train ride to Nice, he announced he had a
    book of blank passes to be filled out as necessary for the purpose of
    extending our stay.</font></p>

    <p><img border="0" alt="Furlough - World War II - France" src ="images/Furlough_27_163.jpg" width=550 height=371 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Extending Our Stay In Paris</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Instead of catching the train immediately as
    we were supposed to do, we stayed in Paris for over a week enjoying the
    sights. We had to find a civilian hotel because our new passes did not cover
    the Army's living facilities for visiting GIs. Upon our arrival, we left the
    Gare du Nord railroad station carrying our baggage. A few blocks from the
    station, we turned down a narrow side street with the buildings built right
    up against the sidewalks. We wanted to stay away from large civilian hotels
    where there would be other GIs along with inquiring MPs. There was a heavy
    presence of MPs looking for AWOL soldiers and deserters, most of whom were
    living in Paris while dealing in the black market to survive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of the first block we found a
    civilian hotel no bigger than a Chicago three-flat. The owner and his wife
    spoke no English, and the only French words we knew had to do with the
    romancing of young ladies. Usually, we could get our message across through
    gestures to someone who spoke a foreign language, but we were getting no
    place with this couple. We had pulled out some of the special French francs
    issued by the Army, but the couple just kept shaking their heads no, in
    unison. Then, Mel reached into one of the bags of cigarettes we were
    carrying to sell on the black market and pulled out a carton of Lucky
    Strikes. It was almost comical to see the turn of events: we now became the
    ones who had to be convinced the deal we were about to make was
    satisfactory. All of us had pooled our cartons of cigarettes and we had two
    good-sized bags of them (See Fig.164). We haggled a little with the
    proprietor and finally agreed on the number of cartons we would pay. We
    registered and were shown to our rooms by his wife, who had changed from
    someone who could only say no to a new person full of smiles and a positive
    nodding head.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Paris_on_furlough_walking_on_street_27_164a.jpg" width="600" height="432"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Paris_on_furlough_walking_on_street_27_164b.jpg" width="600" height="545"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The rooms were tiny and sparse with a common
    bathroom at the end of the hall. The toilet in the latrine consisted of a
    hole in the floor with a permanent outline of a footprint on each side to
    indicate where to stand. There was a bucket of water in the corner of the
    room to use as a flush. It was only a small improvement over the slit
    trenches we used at gun positions. This was the French version of plumbing,
    and we later found it to be quite common throughout the old part of the
    city. There were no showers, so we were restricted to the pitcher of water
    and basin on the dresser. Our experience with bathing out of a steel helmet
    for many months during the war had well prepared us for this primitive
    living. The view from our bedroom looked out on the narrow street leading to
    our hotel (See Fig. 165). The narrow street was dark even during a day with
    full sunlight. The view left a lot to be desired but it didn't matter
    because we were never there except to sleep. Overall, the accommodations
    weren't much, but they sufficed for our purpose.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Paris_on_furlough_view%20from%20Hotel_27_165.jpg" width="600" height="477"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had plenty of cigarettes left so three of
    us went back to the railroad station the next morning where, upon our
    arrival, we easily recognized civilians who wanted to buy anything made in
    America. We sold them for thirty dollars per carton, pooled the money, and
    made Joe the banker for the rest of the trip. The two men we sold them to
    were about our age and spoke perfect English, complete with southern
    accents. We were sure they were American Army deserters. They insisted we
    move out of the station and into a nearby alley to make the transactions,
    even trying to push us there. We resisted and made the deal in the middle of
    the busy rail station. We would rather have been caught selling the
    cigarettes than risk getting stuck with a knife and losing everything,
    perhaps including our lives. Before leaving Antwerp, other soldiers who had
    been to Paris warned us about these deserters. They were tough, dangerous,
    and in most cases desperate as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In Paris, we ate at Army mess facilities,
    which also weren't covered with our new passes. Mel went out alone soon
    after we arrived at the hotel and found an Army installation about two
    blocks from our hotel. I don't know if he bribed the mess sergeant in charge
    or what, but the facilities opened up to us with no questions asked. Not
    only did we eat free, we did not even have to stand in line with the other
    GIs. We went right to the front of the line for every meal. It would be one
    of many times Mel made arrangements for all of us, and there seemed to be
    nothing that he couldn't do.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were not allowed to go into French
    restaurants because there was still a shortage of food in Paris, but we
    could sit and sip wine at outdoor cafes near our hotel away from the main
    part of the city. Unlike most of the other big cities in Europe, Paris was
    in great shape because it was an open city during the war. There was no
    damage from bombs or artillery shells. The only damage we saw were some
    pockmarks on buildings from rifle or machine gun fire. The French resistance
    fighters had attacked the German occupation forces with small arms fire when
    the Germans were leaving the city with the Allied armies advancing on it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Other than the American Army vehicles, mainly
    Jeeps, there were few motorized vehicles moving around Paris because there
    was almost no gas available for civilian use. Horses and wagons were used to
    transfer most materials (See Fig. 166) while the local citizens were,
    primarily, using the Metro (subway) system to get around. We learned the
    system in a short time and used it extensively.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Paris_on_furlough_Champs_Elysees_27_166.jpg" width="550" height="403"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We saw all the sights of Paris - some of them
    three or four times (see Figs 167 and 168).</font><img border="0" hspace="6" alt="Eifel Tower - Paris on furlough" vspace="6" src="images/Paris_on_furlough_Eifel_Tower_27_167.jpg" width="369" align="right" height="576"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">None of my traveling companions were
    Catholic, so when Sunday came, I took the Metro by myself to Notre Dame
    Cathedral to go to mass. When I got up out of the Metro, the church was
    nowhere in sight. I stopped several people on the street to ask where it
    was. They looked at me like I was from another planet. What's the matter
    with these people, I thought? Haven't they even heard of this edifice?
    Finally, I realized I was saying the name like we did the university in
    South Bend, Indiana. It wasn't even close enough for the Frenchmen to
    understand me. When I walked around the corner, the church was directly
    ahead.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was nothing going on when I arrived, so
    I walked through the church, looking at all the sights. The next mass was
    not going to start for another hour, so I went across the street to a
    barbershop to get my haircut. It was a French shop, and after the barber cut
    my hair, he put some hair lotion on my head, and I smelled like I had taken
    a bath in lavender cologne. During mass, people were turning around and
    looking to see where the smell was coming from. I couldn't wait to get back
    to the hotel and wash my hair.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the evenings, we found places to go for
    amusement. This eventually led us up to the Montmarte section of the city,
    which was on a hilltop. We glanced at the church, Sacre Coeur Basilica, and
    immediately headed for the theater that was showing Les Folies Bergere. It
    was the number one item on the must-see list from every GI we knew who had
    visited Paris before us. The beautiful showgirls who came out undressed from
    the waist up and stayed that way throughout the show were obviously the main
    attraction.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Paris on furlough - World War II - Russell, Bob and Joe" src ="images/Paris_on_furlough_Russell_Bob_Joe_27_168.jpg" width=600 height=463 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Seamy Side of Paris</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One night we took the Metro to the
    neighborhood called Place Pigale, which had a very seamy reputation because
    of its low class bars and their unsavory patrons. It was the red-light
    district of Paris, and after seeing it we all concluded it had been properly
    nicknamed Pig Alley. We walked along the street and saw all the sights.
    There were street hawkers selling trinkets that could easily be defined as
    junk. Women of varying ages who all had one common denominator-they looked
    hard and tough-moved through the mix of GIs and civilian men. Many of the
    shop windows were decorated with obscene pictures. Doormen in front of some
    bars offered promises of exotic behavior within and those who were not
    involved in selling sex were yelling at the GIs, "Cigarettes?
    Cigarettes?" We would not go into any of the cafes, as the French
    called them, because they looked so sordid. Some of the places had live
    shows that were touted as many things, but they really came down to strip
    joints. One of our group commented they looked like the place where they
    shot those training films on the evils of social diseases we had seen in the
    States.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite one of the biggest stereotypes about
    GIs, we were not all heavy drinkers, womanizers and hell raisers when
    released on passes or furloughs into the civilian population. I don't know
    how typical or atypical the five of us were, but our conduct on this trip
    showed little tendency toward either extreme of being wild or subdued. While
    we all enjoyed drinking beer and flirting with any young girl we saw, the
    line was drawn on rowdy behavior. We represented five different batteries, a
    wide range of ages, a mixture of marital statuses, and a good blend of
    different personalities. While we continued to swear, the frequency and
    grossness were greatly reduced and we were acting a lot more like gentlemen
    than carousing military men. I had noticed this improvement in behavior when
    our outfit arrived in Antwerp. It might have been the return to an urban
    area where we began to mingle with more civilized people, or maybe we no
    longer had to prove something by our coarseness. This is not to infer all
    GIs were cleaning up their acts, because the action along the street we were
    on shouted otherwise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On our way back to the Metro, we came across
    a large building in the Pigale District that the American Government had set
    up as a nightclub to entertain GIs. There were four of these nightclubs in
    Paris, set up primarily to prevent price gouging. They had a dual advantage
    of keeping the GIs out of the sleazy places we had just seen. Somebody who
    knew how some GIs thought and behaved was really thinking straight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We paid a dollar each to get in and found it
    to be packed with hundreds of people. It was a huge place with a stage at
    one end and tables set up around a large dance floor. There was a balcony
    around three sides that was so crowded we wondered what kept it from falling
    down under the weight. Most of those present were GIs and about a quarter
    were their civilian dates or WACs (Women's Army Corps: American women
    soldiers). Almost everyone was drinking champagne, which was the big seller.
    Some tables had a dozen or more bottles on them. The GIs would not let the
    waitresses remove empty bottles because contests were developing between
    tables to see which one could drink the greatest number. We ordered a couple
    of bottles that cost four dollars each. Everyone was drinking heavily, and
    the place was extremely noisy with loud conversation, laughter, and
    shouting. Almost everyone was smoking, and a heavy haze hung in the air.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A stage show came on, and it lasted more than
    an hour and a half. It was top-notch entertainment, and the audience loved
    it. Typical of European theatrical shows at that time, it included acts with
    trained animals, tumblers, and jugglers. The hit of the show was a great
    girl singer who was able to hold the attention of the audience by singing
    the popular upbeat songs of the day. She sang most of them in English and
    then repeated the words in French, which made them sound even better. Next
    on the bill was a small chorus line of dancers. There was nothing indecent
    about the dancers, but some of the GIs were making off-color comments about
    them that made other members of the audience howl. The girls continued to
    smile as they danced as though they were use to this kind of reaction. The
    noise was so great you could not talk to the person next to you. The five of
    us had good seats at a round table next to the dance floor where the acts
    performed, and we got caught up in all the excitement. After the show, the
    place quieted down somewhat, but everyone was so wound up it was barely
    noticeable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a large round table next to us with
    six paratroopers and four girls seated at it. The paratroopers had all kinds
    of ribbons on their uniforms, which indicated they had seen a lot of action
    during the war. The girls were young, but they looked as hard as nails.
    Everyone at the table was drunk, really drunk, and we knew it would not take
    much of a spark to start trouble.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after the conclusion of the show, a band
    started to play and many of the couples in the audience headed for the dance
    floor. One of the paratroopers at the adjoining table wanted one of the
    girls in his party to dance with him, but she kept refusing him. She kept
    repeating, "You're too drunk." They both stood right behind me,
    and I was listening as they shouted at one another. The paratrooper leaned
    on his table to steady himself while a cigarette with a one-inch ash dangled
    from his mouth. He did not look as though he was old enough to smoke, much
    less be in the Army. After several refusals by the girl, the paratrooper
    hauled off and hit her smack in the face with the palm of his hand. The blow
    would have floored most girls, but not this one. She shook off the blow,
    picked up a champagne bottle, and swung it as his head. Either someone
    deflected it or she was too drunk to hit her target, and she just grazed his
    body. He then turned, grabbed her, and threw her out onto the dance floor
    where she nearly knocked over some of the dancers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Several GIs who had observed what had
    happened came to the aid of the damsel in distress, even though it was a
    great stretch of the imagination to call her a damsel. This might have been
    a gallant thing to do, but it was also the wrong thing because in just a
    minute, a fight had begun. It mushroomed into half a dozen fights and soon,
    people were throwing punches at everyone within reach for no obvious reason.
    One of the paratroopers yelled "Geronimo!" the paratroopers'
    battle<img border="0" hspace="6" alt="Bob Gallagher in Paris on Furlough - World War II" vspace="6" src="images/Paris_on_furlough_Champs_Elysees_Bob_Gallagher_27_169.jpg" width="427" align="right" height="607"> cry. The place must have been filled with them because they started
    to come from all directions, some of them swinging down onto the dance floor
    from the balcony. Everyone was headed for the melee, and the place was in
    pandemonium. We were at the epicenter of the fight, and it was hard to stay
    out of it because we were being pounded with blows from people we had never
    seen before. The paratrooper who had started the fight was standing up on
    his table dropkicking empty champagne bottles into the crowd. The four MPs
    near the front door stepped in to stop the action, but they were too
    outnumbered to make any difference.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The five of us finally locked arms, made our
    way to a side exit with a lot of pushing, and got out of there in a hurry.
    With our fictitious passes, we did not want to get picked up in a riot. As
    we left the area, we saw several Jeeps and a truckload of MPs headed for the
    club. That was our one and only trip to Pigale. We kidded each other the
    rest of our trip about who had the idea to go there in the first place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While in Paris, I bought Caron perfume for my
    mother and sister, Joan. The city was exciting because there was so much to
    see and do. We took many pictures (See Fig. 169). Between seeing the
    historical sights and participating in the active nightlife, we kept very
    busy.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Nice Was Nice</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally we took a train to Nice. When we
    arrived, everyone from the train was going to the same hotel as we were, so
    when we reached the front door, we found a line extending down the street
    for a block. Everyone was queued up to register. Mel left us and headed to
    the hotel entrance. A few minutes later, he was waving for the four of us to
    come and join him. To a lot of catcalls from the GIs in line, we went in and
    right up to our rooms. We were at the Rual Hotel (See Figs. 170a and 170b), which was
    being managed by the American Government. It was right on the Mediterranean
    Sea and our rooms overlooked the water. It was an old majestic hotel with
    ornate furnishings and decorations. The main lobby looked like something out
    of an elaborate castle we had seen in London.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Nice_France_Rual_Hotel_27_170a.jpg" width="700" height="556"></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Nice_France_Rual_Hotel_27_170b.jpg" width="600" height="463"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition to having nice accommodations,
    there were many things arranged for us to do. There were bus trips to a
    perfume factory in Cannes and to a winery near Grasse. A boat trip down the
    coast past the northern coast of Italy was a big hit. We walked down the
    boardwalk in front of the hotel and watched the girls sunbathing on the
    beach. (See Fig. 170c)</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/Nice_France_Beach_27_170c.jpg" width="700" height="509"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were signs posted around the hotel that read, "No saluting
    required." (See Fig. 171a) The area known as Old Nice was interesting
    with its narrow cobblestone streets (See Fig. 171b) and cemeteries with the graves above
    ground. We marveled at the town cistern (See Fig. 171c), located in the middle of a busy
    square, where mothers were washing their clothing and giving their children
    baths out in the open.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Nice, France - no saluting area" src ="images/Nice_France_No_Soluting_27_171a.jpg" width=550 height=491 ></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Cobblestone Street, Nice, France" src ="images/Nice_France_Narrow_Street_27_171b.jpg" width=400 height=650 ></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Town Cistern, Nice, France" src ="images/Nice_France_Bathing_Cistern_27_171c.jpg" width=519 height=704 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We ate our meals, served by uniformed
    waiters, in a very elegant dining room in the hotel. The tables had white
    tablecloths, expensive china, and ornate silverware. This was quite a change
    from the Army facilities, and it took several days to get accustomed to it.
    A stringed combo played chamber music during lunch and dinner. Mel would
    take a small amount of our pooled money and tip the combo members to play
    our favorite tunes. He kept selecting Debussy's Claire de Lune until we all
    got sick of it. None of the rest of us had heard it played before getting to
    Nice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The border between France and Monte Carlo was
    only a few blocks from our hotel but Monte Carlo was off-limits to us.
    However, we did take a ride on a motor launch and sailed along the shoreline
    of this beautiful but minute country (See Fig. 171d).</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Motor Launch past Monte Carlo" src ="images/Nice_France_Boat_27_171d.jpg" width=497 height=713 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">GI nightclubs were set up around the
    area of our hotel for the troops to enjoy and the movie theaters had all the
    latest releases from Hollywood. A Red Cross Club, where they had dances and
    served food, was located just a few doors down from our hotel, also facing
    the water. We went there occasionally, but we preferred some of the other
    clubs that were more exciting. It was all a lot of fun, and it was hard to
    leave when our stay was up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On the way back to Antwerp, we stopped for
    another look at Paris. Then we went on to Brussels for several days. We had
    planned to stay longer but, after Paris, Brussels seemed a little boring and
    we kept our visit short. Like all tourists who visit that city, we marveled
    at the fact they would erect a statue of a boy relieving himself and
    consider it to be one of their national treasurers, regardless of its
    symbolism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All together, I believe we were gone for over
    three weeks. I was quite apprehensive about getting back to our unit in
    Antwerp, even though Mel kept assuring us nothing would happen. I had never
    been even a minute late from a pass of furlough. As it turned out, my worry
    was for nothing. I arrived, checked in, and signed up for MP duty. No one
    said a word about the extended trip. Our unit was starting to break up. Many
    of the senior noncoms and officers had already been shipped home for
    discharges. They had the longest amount of service and, therefore, the most
    number of points. It was no problem operating without them because by this
    time, we all knew what was expected of us, and we did it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Shortly after arriving back from my furlough,
    we heard Captain McKee was being rotated home. The rumor was there was going
    to be a big ceremony to honor him for his leadership of the 815th Battalion,
    Battery D. It was true we had seen little of him since we arrived in
    Antwerp, when he directed our truck and nine others, in perfect military
    unison, into a peat bog. We had not had a single battery formation since we
    had been in the Antwerp area, so it was impossible for him to give us one of
    his famous inspirational speeches about military discipline. We were
    disappointed when we heard he left without any fanfare because the plan was
    to have the biggest sick call the battery had ever seen on the day of the
    ceremony.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A new captain from some other outfit was
    assigned to us. He was the most laid-back officer we had ever met-the
    complete opposite of McKee. We lamented about what might have been if we had
    only had him to start with. We heard stories about him speeding through the
    downtown area of Antwerp in his Jeep after spending an evening drinking at
    the officers club. Several of our MPs out on patrol and in their own Jeeps
    stopped him and drove him back to his quarters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">With the war over and our duties guarding
    prisoners behind us, we had expected to spend our remaining time in the
    service in peaceful pursuits. It would not turn out that way, as we
    experienced some very exciting times during our MP duties.</font></p>
