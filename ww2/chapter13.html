    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, we were informed that we were moving
    out, but, as usual, not specifically where we were going. Even without that
    knowledge, there was great anticipation as we were sure that it meant we
    were finally going across the English Channel to the ETO. It also meant we
    were leaving the detested Camp Stapley.</font></p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/Loading_LSTs_13_70.jpg" width="600" height="390"></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We loaded up our trucks, hitched up
    our guns, and headed southeast to the port of Weymouth on the South coast,
    which was only about a forty-mile trip from our camp. It was March 1, 1945.
    Morale was extremely high and I later wondered if the overall display of
    near euphoria was actually hidden nervousness. We stayed there in Temporary
    Camp RCRP-06 for several days as we loaded up all of our equipment on
    Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) (See Fig. 70). These ships were 328 feet in length
    and 50 feet wide. They are capable of unloading military men and equipment
    without the use of dock facilities. They could sail headfirst right up on a
    beach, the front end had two large doors that opened to a width of 14 feet,
    a ramp went down, and trucks, tanks, or any other vehicle were driven right
    up on land. The lower deck was where our trucks, 40 mm guns, M-51 mounts,
    and the heavier equipment were stored. Lighter equipment like the portable
    kitchens was carried on the upper deck. There were rooms for the troops
    along the sides with bench like seats. The vessel was powered by two diesel
    engines and had a cruising speed of approximately nine knots. The vessel was
    armed with seven 40 mm and twelve 20 mm antiaircraft guns. The crew of the
    ship was manning them. It took longer than anticipated to load our equipment
    on board because the guns and trucks all had to be backed in and then
    chained down.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We sailed across the English Channel for
    France. We had been warned to expect a rough ride, and it was. The ship
    seemed to roll and pitch so much that we had trouble staying on the smooth
    wooden benches we were sitting on. The chains holding down the guns and
    trucks were straining under the load they were holding. While some of the
    troops got sick, I didn't, although it was close. We were on the ship for
    about twenty-four hours, but I don't know how much of that time was sailing
    and how much was just sitting in the harbor. We had no portholes to see out,
    and we were not near the engine room.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, the rolling and pitching let up, and
    we were notified that we were nearing shore. The LST stopped suddenly and
    the ship lurched slightly to one side. We stepped out of our quarters into
    the loading bay to see the doors swing open onto a sandy beach. The weather
    was sunny and bright. Beyond the beach, was another story. The view was one
    of mass destruction. My first view of Europe was the sight of the totally
    bombed-out city that we would later learn was Le Havre, France. It was March
    6th, exactly nine months to the day since the Allied Forces landed in
    Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We loaded up on our trucks and drove up onto
    the beach. "Welcome to the ETO!" several men cried out. The truck
    that I was on with eight of our fifteen-man gun crew was pulling the 40 mm
    gun behind it. The truck behind us had the rest of our crew aboard, and they
    were pulling the M-51 mount with its four .50 caliber machine guns. Our gun
    could not fire from a traveling position, but the mount could. We had not
    even drawn ammunition yet for our 40 mms, but the machine gun mount was
    loaded and ready to go. There was a man in the bucket seat, and two other
    men were riding on the mount to act as loaders if necessary. Following the
    gun crews off the ship were the supply, mess, and headquarters vehicles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although I had seen some bomb damage in
    London and in newsreels, I was not prepared for what I saw in Le Havre once
    we got in position to observe the overall landscape. The city was just a
    mass of rubble. Although we would see some heavily damaged cities later in
    Germany and other parts of Europe, Le Havre may have been the worst. Where
    were the people who lived there? How did those who were left manage to live
    in the midst of such total destruction? These were the questions we asked
    ourselves. This was a good-size city, and for as far as you could see, it
    had been laid to total waste. We didn't see a single building still standing
    in its entirety, and there were large areas where not a visible part of a
    buildings could be seen - just piles of rubble where they had stood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We wondered about the French people who had
    lived there. How did they feel about the total ruin of their city? Certainly
    they were happy to be liberated from German occupation, but at what cost?
    Thousands of civilians must have been killed in the battle for the city.
    They had lost their homes and everything else they owned that was in them.
    It was a heavy price to pay, and they must have had many mixed feelings
    about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">
    We pulled our truck up onto a street that had been cleared of debris by Army
    bulldozers to line up for our convoy. It was quite an exciting time for all
    of us; even though we were not near the combat zone, we knew that we were
    headed there. There was some light chatter about the fact that it had taken
    so long to finally arrive in the ETO but also a feeling of seriousness about
    our mission.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had just lined our truck up in the convoy,
    when a Jeep came by with Sergeant Kornich yelling, "gas masks, gas
    masks."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Did he say 'drill'?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"No! Just 'gas masks'."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Are you sure?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Yeah, I'm sure, you a--h---. Get your
    gas mask on."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"I can't find mine."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Let me have that flash light when
    you're through."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"That's mine!"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Like hell it is. There's my serial
    number."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Help me lift these sandbags."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Did he say put them on?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">" No! He wants you to sit on it for a
    pillow, you idiot."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">These were the comments being thrown out as
    there was a mad scramble to find our masks among all of the equipment on the
    truck. We had no idea if it was a drill or the real thing so we weren't
    about to take any chances. We were tearing up piles of sandbags, lifting
    equipment, and digging deep into the truck because we had made no effort to
    keep them handy. It took us a good fifteen minutes to find all of them, and
    fortunately it was only a drill. The experience taught us a lesson, and from
    then on we hung the masks in a prescribed spot whenever we were on the
    truck. When we were off it, they were hanging around out necks at all times
    as required.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Germany, Italy, Britain and the United
      States all had large quantities of gas available for use in World War II.
      Because of the heavy casualties from the use of gas during World War I,
      the Allied countries feared that the Axis countries would use theirs and
      the Axis countries felt the same. Therefore, neither did.<sup>1</sup></i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It may seem strange now, but we really had no
    idea how the overall war was going. It was as if we felt like pawns caught
    up in some big operation where it really didn't make any difference what we
    knew. What could we do about our situation, anyhow? The surprising thing
    was, we no longer made any special attempt to find out. This was in spite of
    the fact that the progress of the war would greatly dictate our eventual
    role in it. As far as how we fit into this war now that we were in a theater
    of operations and specifically, the need for antiaircraft units, we had been
    given some cursory information just before we left Camp Stapley. From
    talking with one of the sergeants from Headquarters Battery, we had learned
    that the effectiveness of the German Luftwaffe had been greatly reduced at
    this point but it was a long way from being dead. The Allied air forces had
    gained air superiority some months earlier so the Germans were reduced to
    making sneak and desperate attacks. These attacks were often carried out by
    fighter planes coming in on a target at low altitude. The type of guns we
    had were some of the best defensive tools against these kinds of raids.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>More than 2,500 German aircraft were
      observed over positions held by the American troops from the time we
      arrived in France until the end of the war.<sup>2</sup></i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A lone old man came by as we were parked
    there waiting for more trucks to line up. He was pulling a small cart,
    gathering scrap lumber (there was a lot of scrap about). There were no other
    civilians in sight. We had been given a small booklet with English-to-French
    and French-to-English phrases, and some of the men were trying them out on
    the old man. He looked quite bewildered as half-a-dozen men were yelling at
    him, "Bonjour, monsieur" or "Parlez-vous Francais?" What
    did they think he spoke?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our convoy was formed in a very prescribed
    order. It was perhaps a reminder that the scenery may have changed, but the
    army's way of doing things hadn't. Headquarters Company was in the lead,
    followed by Batteries A, B, C, and D, in that order. Within each battery, we
    lined up by gun sections in numerical order with two trucks per gun section.
    After we were all formed in the prescribed order, we moved off, going east
    into northern France. We were not too concerned about an aerial attack
    because we had a tremendous concentration of guns available for protection.
    There were four letter batteries with M-51 mounts, eight gun sections in
    each battery and four .50 caliber machine guns on each mount for a total of
    one hundred and twenty eight .50 caliber machine guns in our convoy. With
    that amount of firepower, we would have offered stiff resistance to strafing
    enemy planes. However, we felt a certain sense of apprehension from being in
    this land of destruction and anticipation of what we were getting into. This
    was the real thing, the thing that we had been training for so long. We
    began to wonder how far we were from the combat zone and when we would be
    getting into our first action.</font></p>
