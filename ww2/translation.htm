<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Bob Gallagher, artilleryman in a group   
of the mobile DCA (anti-aircraft defense), took advantage of a week’s   
furlough in Nice by altering his leave documents to extend his stay   
in Paris.  Accompanied by four other GI’s from each of the other batteries   
of his unit, he embarked from the North Station in August 1945.&nbsp;</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At first, they needed to find lodging  
in a “civilian”&nbsp;hotel rather than an establishment controlled  
by the army, to which their falsified permits did not give them access.   
To avoid the MP patrols searching for deserters, they found a hotel  
typical of those which abound around Parisian train stations on a little  
street nearby. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite a number of efforts in sign  
language and the brandishing of army-printed franc banknotes, our four  
vacationers failed to get a room--until one of them extracted a large  
sack of packets of cigarettes accumulated for a discreet resale on the  
black market.  The hotel staff suddenly smiled and one quickly agreed  
upon a number of cartons which paid for shelter.&nbsp;</font></p> 
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Americans were surprised by the  
limited comforts they were offered, but that residence was preferable  
to sleeping in a trench and washing in a basin consisting of a heavy  
helmet full of frequently unchanged cold water.&nbsp;</font></p> 
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The next morning, always around the  
North Station, our accomplices managed to sell their cigarettes to some  
civilians.  Oddly, their clients spoke excellent English, with an accent  
of the southern United States!  They suggested the transaction be concluded  
in a nearby alley, but, rather than risk being stabbed by potential  
deserters, the sale occurred in the train station.&nbsp;</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The remainder of their stay consisted  
of visits, made easier by the Metro, which impressed with its speed  
and complete network.  Rationing did not allow GIs to eat in a restaurant,  
but they took ample advantage of the outdoor cafes.&nbsp;</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the Pigalle section, known as <i> 
Pig Alley</i> since their fathers discovered its popularity in 1918,  
our four friends went into the nightclubs managed by the American army.   
The numbers, very professional and appreciated, in particular those  
by a singer who knew the fashionable American airs, were followed by  
a chorus line of dancers.&nbsp; But a fight broke out, triggered by  
drunken parachutists in the company of <i>entraîneuses</i> [young females  
often employed by bars and discos whose role is to push clients to drink  
and dance].  Our artillerymen managed to break away before the arrival  
of the MP.  They finally took their train for the <i>Riviera Recreational  
Area.</i>&nbsp; 
  Upon their return to Belgium, with their absence unnoticed,  
the group prepared to return home.&nbsp;</font></p>
