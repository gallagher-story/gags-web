    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we finally started to get passes to
    leave camp, we jumped at the opportunity. The pass proper consisted of a
    small slip of paper signed by some officer that indicated the limited amount
    of time we were allowed to be away from camp. We picked them up at the
    orderly room where we signed off on a ledger to tell what time we left the
    battery area and then again when we returned. We were encouraged to help
    ourselves to a prophylactic kit (called a pro kit) that contained two condoms and a <img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Bob Gallagher in Riverside, California" vspace="10" src="images/Bob_Gallagher_California_Ike_Jacket_4_33.jpg" width="300" align="left" height="518"> small tube
    of medicine that was available there in a cardboard box next to where the
    passes were handed out. We had been shown an Army training film about how to
    use the kit and the possible ramifications if they weren't used. The films
    were graphic and not something that you would easily forget. Almost everyone
    took a packet because it was a way of showing your grand intentions. In
    reality, true expectations for their use were considerably less, and even
    lower expenditure than that usually resulted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At first, the passes were just to go into the
    nearby town of Riverside for Saturday afternoon and evening. Any trip out of
    camp required that we wear a class-A uniform. This meant either a full khaki
    or wool olive drab (OD) uniform, depending on the weather, complete with
    ties. Fatigues were allowed out of camp only on a military convoy when we
    were going to another site or on bivouac. The wool OD uniform required a
    blouse to be worn while out of the camp. About halfway through our training
    we were issued the new "Ike" (General Dwight D. Eisenhower)
    jackets (See Fig. 33). We considered their more stylish look to be a big
    improvement over the previous model. All passes out of Camp Haan started
    with a mile walk down to the camp's main gate where we caught an army bus
    ride into the center of Riverside. There was a regular shuttle service
    between the camp and the town. For any trip beyond Riverside, we relied on
    hitchhiking for transportation because it had two big advantages over
    commercial buses that were also available: It was free and always much
    faster.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In
    1943, Riverside was a small and beautiful southern California town with a
    small mission to identify it as a historical site. Most of the homes and
    even the railroad station had those architecture features of white or
    pastel-colored stucco walls with red tile roofs that were unique to that
    part of the country. There were flowerbeds in abundance, and even the
    business district was ablaze with colorful flowers during most of the year.
    I had never seen most of the varieties of flowers before that time. The
    citizens were friendly as a general rule, and they had set up a large
    canteen for the enlisted men to enjoy. However, the canteen and everything
    else in town, including out on the sidewalks, was so crowded with GI's that
    it was a reminder that you were not completely removed from military life.
    There were still officers aplenty who required a salute, military police
    (MPs) walking the streets and a general feeling that you were not completely
    free of Army regulations. Those factors kept the trips from being a complete
    'get away from it all' experience. On the plus side, any place was better
    than camp and it was a chance to get away from the routine of daily army
    life. It offered some different scenery. A trip out of camp also meant that
    you could not be selected for some special work assignment on your off duty
    time. It must have been a great shock to the permanent residents of
    Riverside and other towns like it that were near army camps to be overrun by
    tens of thousands of soldiers who had recently become their neighbors. There
    was no way to accommodate such an influx of people without having some
    problems. Housing was at a premium, and every spare room in private homes
    was rented out, usually, to the wife of some soldier stationed nearby at a
    rate higher than the going amount in other parts of the country. All
    businesses, especially the bars, did a thriving business. My friends and I
    selected the bars we would return to on future passes. We tried the
    serviceman's canteen and found little to enjoy there. It was always over
    crowded and it had the feeling of being more like a cross between a church
    and a library. Le Claire described it as being "short on action and big
    on boredom."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The bars were fairly quiet in the daytime
    while the noise picked up dramatically after dark. This was mainly the
    effect of the extended hours spent drinking and somewhat to the more
    expansive playing of the jukebox in the later hours. One of the anomalies of
    California that I noticed immediately was the popularity of what I called
    "hillbilly music." I had thought that this was limited to the deep
    southern states but it was played extensively in the bars, soda fountains,
    social clubs, and elsewhere throughout that part of the country. I had
    trouble finding a song that I enjoyed on some jukeboxes and the continuous
    playing of a few of the most popular country songs of the day became more
    than a little tiring.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, after more weeks of training, we got
    some two-day passes and several times we traveled to nearby San Bernardino
    and then up into the mountains nearby to the resort areas of Lake Arrowhead
    and Big Bear Lake. The scenery up there was spectacular, and it was always
    hard to leave.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" alt="Zoot Suit" src ="images/Zoot_Suit_4_34.jpg" width=200 align=right height=530 >We
    were warned about the Mexican-American civilian gangs in nearby San Bernardino who were
    called Zoot Suiters. They dressed in outrageous - looking black suits all the time,
    regardless of the weather (See Fig. 34). The jackets were knee length, and
    had extremely wide and padded shoulders. The pants had a high waist, blossomed out like
    bloomers, and tapered into a tight fit at the ankles. Their black
    "porkpie" fedoras had a very wide brim, flat on the top and often
    sported a large feather. They wore black shoes with high heels and thick
    soles, white dress shirts with a large flared collar, garish colored ties
    sometimes tied in a bow, and a gold watch chain that tied to their belt and
    looped down to their ankles. The chain was twirled out in front of them as
    some form of gang ritual. Their hair was slicked back on the sides in a
    “ducktail” style. Despite their freakish looks, this was a tough
    bunch and we were told to travel only in large groups when we were in their
    territory. There were several incidents between them and the GIs while we
    were at Camp Haan. Later, we heard that contingents of these gangs attacked
    and badly beat eleven sailors on shore leave in Los Angeles. On the
    following night, 200 sailors descended on<br>
    Los Angeles to seek revenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Later,
    many soldiers joined with the sailors. The resulting riots, that lasted for
    several days, resulted in many injuries and was heavily reported in the
    local newspapers. The incident was called “Zoot Suit Riots” but was also
    referred to as “sailors riots.”&nbsp; I
    don't know why the Zoot Suiters were not in the armed services because most
    of them looked like they were of draft age. It might have been because they
    had police records.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, we were eligible for an occasional
    three-day pass. We would take a bus into Riverside and then hitchhike into
    the Los Angeles area. The civilian drivers would stop and pick us up
    immediately, and they would often go out of their way to drop us off at our
    final destination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our number one destination in the L.A. area
    was Hollywood because that's where the action was. There was dormitories set
    up in homes, schools, churches, and lodges just to accommodate service men
    on leave. We usually paid a nominal fee like fifty cents or a dollar per
    night for a bed that always included a continental breakfast. One of our
    more important stops in Hollywood would be the Hollywood Canteen over on
    Canuenga Boulevard (See Fig. 35) during the day to see many of the big-name
    movie stars. They also served free food there, which made our budgets
    stretch further. I had a nice chat with two of the big movie stars of the
    day, Walter Pigeon and Marsha Hunt, while there. I also got tickets and went
    to several radio shows, including Bob Hope's and Jimmy Durante's.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Hollywood Canteen" src ="images/Hollywood_Canteen_4_35.jpg" width=400 height=394 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the evening, we usually headed over to The
    Palladium Dance Hall (See Fig. 36). It's hard to describe the size of this
    ballroom and the action that was going on inside. It was like stepping into
    another world: a world of excitement and anticipation. It could only be
    compared to one of today's giant rock concerts; only it was a little more
    civilized. One of the nation's big dance bands was always playing there. I
    saw Gene Krupa and Woody Herman several times. There were thousands of
    service men from every branch of the military with a few civilian men and
    thousands of sun-tanned California girls - mostly blonde and beautiful. The
    girls were decked out in their Sunday best. We entered and stood in a large
    lobby-like area next to the dance floor, checking out the girls while they
    were rating us. The huge crystal chandeliers, mirrored walls, and ornate
    architecture made the place look like some regal palace. Off in the distance
    across the dance floor, about a block away, would be Woody Herman, slightly
    bent over, walking and swaying up and down the elevated stage, playing his
    clarinet. Loud speakers were blaring the music around the room. If you
    wanted to get a good look at Woody, you had to dance about three numbers
    while you worked your way through the crowded dance floor up to the
    bandstand. The noise was loud and the music was great, while the orchestra
    played all of the great songs of the day. Then the band would start into one
    of its swing numbers, and everyone dancing would go into his or her
    jitterbug act. The place would rock with excitement. It was fun to hear,
    watch, and participate. To say that we loved the Palladium Ballroom would
    understate our feelings. It was a dynamic and entertaining place to be.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Palladium Dance Hall" src ="images/Palladium_dance_hall_4_36.jpg" width=500 height=304 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we left there late in the evening, we
    would go to one of the big cocktail lounges around town. They usually had a
    combo or a full-sized orchestra playing and a small dance floor. They would
    be mobbed with people, most of whom were in the service, some with dates. We
    would stand up at the bar, which was about four deep with people. Most of us
    drank only beer, but there were a couple of rum drinks available that
    created a lot of interest. One was called the Cuba Libra, a mixture of Coke
    and rum. The other called a Zombie, consisted of eight kinds of rum, which
    was guaranteed to produce a drunken state immediately and an unbelievable
    headache the next day. While everyone would talk about these drinks, there
    were few people who would actually partake of them, at least more than once.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;The elaborate cocktail lounges and semi
    nightclubs in L.A. were exciting places to be, especially for a young adult
    like myself who, prior to entering the army, had never seen anything like
    this before. It made me feel very grown up and somehow part of the swinging
    "Hollywood Set." In civilian life, my fake ID only gained me
    entrance to the lowliest of saloons in my immediate neighborhood where the
    proprietor would sacrifice a chance to be raided by the police for serving
    minors in order to make a few extra dollars. The L.A. places were ornate,
    busy and noisy; and the (fake) IDs we carried to extend our ages up into the
    legitimate range never seemed to be required to gain entrance. Once in a
    while, a fight would break out in one of the bars, but it would usually be
    stopped immediately. The nightclubs always had civilian bouncers as big as
    gorillas who would quiet the pushing matches before they escalated. For all
    the drinking and revelry that was going on and the mixing of different
    service personnel, the places were quite civilized. Occasionally, we would
    go to one of Hollywood's well-know nightclubs like the Brown Derby, just to
    say we had been there. We usually just went to the bar and had one or two
    beers because the place was too expensive to stay very long on our limited
    finances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We would hitchhike back to Riverside on
    Sunday afternoon, catch a bus there, and be in camp by midnight when our
    passes were up, in time for bed check. The time spent in Hollywood gave us
    lasting memories that we strove to duplicate as often as possible. They were
    difficult to match anyplace else.</font></p>
