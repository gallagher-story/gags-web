    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We finally learned we were located just
    outside the town of Riverside, California, about thirty miles south of Los
    Angeles. As we sat in the rail cars, we could hear the roar of aircraft
    landing and taking off nearby. We were sure we were at an air base, and we
    began to congratulate each other we were going to be part of the Army Air
    Force. At that time, the Air Force was a branch of the</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Camp Haan Recruits Arriving" vspace="8" src="images/Recruits_at_Camp_Haan_3_17.jpg" width="300" align="right" height="347"><font face="Arial" size="3"> Army and not a
    separate service like it is today. However, when we unloaded at about 1800
    hours there were signs on the platform identified our new location as an
    antiaircraft camp named Camp Haan (See Fig.17). We were more than a little
    disappointed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I said dejectedly to one of my new buddies,
    "I was hoping that we were going to be Air Force but it sure doesn't
    look like it."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">He replied, "We're about as far removed
    from the Air Force as you can get. In fact, we're anti-air force only they
    call it antiaircraft."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The planes we heard were stationed at March
    Air Force Base, across the road and just east of our new camp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Camp Haan was large and, at its peak, had a
    population of 80,000. It was typical of many other camps all over the
    country that trained recruits to be soldiers. Like Camp Grant, this place
    lacked beauty and could exist only as a place to train soldiers. All
    buildings were made of wood and had a temporary look about them. There
    wasn't a tree, bush, blade of grass, or anything else green throughout its
    sprawling acres. Open areas were covered with gravel. The paved streets were
    laid out in a grid-like pattern that somehow accentuated the monotonous look
    of the place (See Fig.18). Clean it was. Not a piece of litter could be
    found anywhere, all picked up and disposed of in a process we would learn
    about later by the abundance of laborers called GIs. Battalions were
    segregated into designated areas, the only difference between them a small
    red sign with white lettering for each unit, about two feet square, that was
    attached to buildings facing the road. We were marched in formation from the
    train to Area #7, our base for most of the time we were in California. We
    spotted a PX (Post Exchange) and a</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">movie
    theater, and wondered if they were the only ones to service this huge camp.</font></p>
    <p><img border="1" alt="Camp Haan Aerial View" src ="images/Camp_Haan_Aerial_View_3_18.jpg" width=600 height=576 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The huts we were assigned to were
    fourteen-feet by fourteen-feet in size (See Fig. 19). They were made of
    plywood on the outside with exposed two-by-four lumber showing inside and
    they looked like a good wind would blow them away. They had no insulation,
    inside finish, or even a coat of paint. One of the country boys in our hut
    commented, "I've been in a lot of outhouses but this is the first time
    I'm gonna sleep in one." The upper part of the hut was screened in and
    there were awnings, also made of plywood sheets that could be lowered over
    the screening during a rainstorm. Inside, there was a wooden floor, a
    potbelly stove, and canvas cots with wooden frames. Each cot had a
    three-inch-thick mattress. The hut slept six men.</font></p>
    <p><img border="1" alt="Camp Haan Six Man Huts" src ="images/Camp_Haan_SixMan_Huts_Street_3_19.jpg" width=400 height=374 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">With no furniture but the cots, we used our
    duffel bags as dressers. Radios, pictures, or anything else of a personal
    nature could not be exhibited. The huts reminded me of little fishing shacks
    I had once seen on a frozen lake. It was obvious all structures in the camp,
    from the latrine and dining room to the shacks where we slept, were geared
    toward functionality. Anything that could even remotely be construed as a
    luxury was not a consideration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All the men who arrived by train were
    assigned to the 815th Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA), Automatic Weapons (AW)
    Battalion. The Battalion was further classified as being Semi Mobile (SM).
    That meant the guns were towed by trucks instead of being self-propelled.
    The main weapons of our unit were 40mm guns that could fire two rounds per
    second on automatic, or be set to fire single shots. We would spend many
    hours learning how to operate and maintain them. The camp also had a large
    number of 90mm gun Battalions and one with 120mm guns. We were impressed
    with the size of our guns until we saw those larger ones. Being around guns
    was to be a new experience for me, and it was all very interesting. I would
    later be assigned to Battery D (called Dog Battery), First Platoon, and Gun
    Section Number 1. In addition to myself, fourteen men were designated for
    this gun section. They were Bud Dillon, R. Williams, "Red" Wilson,
    Jim Grimes, Glenn Le Claire, Joe Bernal, Bob Armbruster, R. Stevens, Jim
    Crow, J. Hughes, Vern Bapst, Jack Thomas, Mel Spearing and Wellington.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">No stripes were passed out until later in our
    training. We were all buck privates to start.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My Battery-D was billeted in two rows of ten
    huts with a gravel-covered open space approximately fifty feet wide between
    them. We referred to this open area as "the street," although
    there was no vehicular traffic on it. It was there that we lined up whenever
    we were called out to formation. At one end of each street was a large
    building containing the latrine with toilets, washbasins, and showers.
    Inside, the row of toilets was located right across from the line of
    washbasins with no partitions or doors anywhere. The shower room had a
    concrete floor and spigots protruded from three of the walls. If anyone
    expected or desired privacy, the latrine was not the place for it. In the
    morning, there was a mad scramble to get shaved, showered, and use the
    toilets in time to be ready for roll call. With everyone scurrying about, it
    always amazed me to see several men shaving with straight razors as others
    jostled about them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the other end of the street, there was a
    mess hall and another building that was used partly as a supply room and
    partly as a day room-a classroom during working hours and a recreation room
    off-hours (See Fig. 20). Recreation facilities consisted of one
    ping-pong-table and several smaller tables with chairs for writing letters.
    The day room had no radios, newspapers, magazines, deck of cards, or
    anything else.</font></p>
    <p><img border="1" alt="Camp Haan Mess Hall" src ="images/Camp_Haan_Mess_Hall_3_20.jpg" width=500 height=481 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first full day in camp, we lined up at
    the supply room. Six of us entered the building at a time and stood before a
    counter to be served. We called out our sizes to several men behind the
    counter who then headed back into the storage room to select material from
    stacks of bins. Those who knew their sized fared better than those who
    didn't. A soldier standing next to me had no idea what size he needed except
    for his shoes. The supply corporal, who was waiting on him looked over the
    counter, sized him up by eye, went back to the bins and returned with new
    clothing. "Try these on! If they don't fit, we'll call in the
    tailor," he said with a laugh, because there was no tailor. There were
    no chairs available so the soldier sat on the floor while he pulled on his
    pants. When he stood up the supply person said, "Close enough.
    Next!"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;We were given bedding, another fatigue
    uniform, an additional dress uniform, mess kit with cup, gas mask, steel
    helmet, helmet liner, duffel bag, raincoat, some underwear, and other
    miscellaneous items. We had been given some things at Camp Grant, but this
    time we filled out what the army deemed to be our needs. When we finally had
    our bedding and clothing stacked on the counter, we picked them up and moved
    out of the supply room. One soldier could not refrain from giving the supply
    personnel a parting wise remark. "You forgot the white sheets," he
    said sarcastically. The supply sergeant responded, "We're saving them
    for your hospital bed when some Jap shoots your ass off."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We returned to our huts and made our cots in
    the army's prescribed method with square corners and taut blankets. All
    clothing we were not wearing was stowed in our individual duffel bags. We
    were issued shoulder sleeve insignias (patches) with "AA" letters
    embossed on them designating us as members of an antiaircraft battalion. We
    immediately sewed them onto the left sleeve of our dress uniforms. Each of
    us had been issued a small cloth bag containing needles and thread to do our
    own sewing. Stenciled on the bag was an American eagle and the not very
    military sounding name of "Army Housewife" (See Fig. 21a).<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Army Housewife" vspace="8" src="images/Army_Housewife_3_21.jpg" width="342" align="right" height="440"></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another important item we were issued a
    little later was the Garand M-1 rifle that would become an integral part of
    our life in the Army. It would seldom be more than a few feet away from us.
    We were not yet issued ammunition. We cleaned the rifles by removing the
    heavy layer of grease that the army called "Cosmoline" from the
    metal parts with gasoline. Then we gave them a thin coating of oil. The
    wooden stocks were coated with linseed oil and then buffed with a cloth
    until they shone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Even though we had been in the Army for only
    a short period of time, we continued to strive to get rid of that "new
    recruit" look. One of the items that made us look that way was our new
    steel helmet. We had noticed that the helmets worn by the old timers were
    heavily scuffed and most of the textured paint was worn smooth. The rims
    were usually worn down to bare metal. So, one of the first things we did was
    find a concrete surface and bang our helmets on it. After wearing ourselves
    out from the pounding, we decided the paint job was more durable than we
    thought and it would take many years to get that used look. Later, we found
    out helmets issued some years earlier had different and less permanent paint
    than ours. We never came close to matching their worn down look, and, as
    time went on, we could not have cared less.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We reached the stage where we were
    fully-equipped with clothes and gear. It was now time to get down to
    training so we could be drilled into soldiers. It started out being as bad
    as we expected, and it didn't get much better with time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Meeting Our New Officers and Noncoms</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were called out of our huts and told to
    line up in formation to meet the non-commissioned officers who would give us
    our basic training. They were "regular Army" or "30-year
    men" (thirty years of service in order to retire at full pension) who
    were planning on making a career of the Army. Their average age was
    considerably higher than the young recruits like myself, and they had been
    in the service for a good number of years. It took us about fifteen minutes
    of exposure to them to determine a more loathsome lot would be hard to find.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">They wore brown wide-brimmed corded campaign
    hats with a pointed top complete with indentations (like the hats of
    Canadian Mounted Police). The rest of their uniforms were similar to ours
    with some notable exceptions. Theirs did not shine like ours and certain
    outfits, like their denim fatigues, were a more faded blue, indicating they
    were more seasoned soldiers. Something as unimportant as the difference in
    the color of their uniform was important to them and the envy of us. They
    were exceedingly proud of the fact their fatigues were all one piece while
    ours consisted of a separate blouse and pants. Also, their uniforms were
    spruced up with the all important noncommissioned officers stripes. When
    they wore their dress uniforms, there were usually a couple rows of campaign
    ribbons showing on the left side of their chests. At the beginning of our
    training, we were too green to know what they stood for. They made it clear
    to us they disliked us draftees because we were not "real
    soldiers" like they were. They looked on us with contempt. On the first
    day we met them, we were informed their job was to whip us into soldiers of
    "their caliber." After we got to know them better, that objective
    of being of "their caliber" sent shudders down our spines. Being
    made into well-trained soldiers was one thing, but picking up any of the
    habits relating to how these guys talked and behaved on a social plane was
    something else. They had the moral fiber of snakes, and there was no amount
    of indoctrination that could bring us down to that level. For example, it
    seemed that it was impossible for them to complete a sentence without
    peppering it with obscenities-not just swear words but overly vile language.
    They expounded a constant stream of obscene taunts and foul epithets at us.
    Their grammar in general would have made an English teacher cringe. We were
    learning one of the axioms of life: the amount of swearing someone does is
    usually inversely proportionate to the amount of education he has. I had
    just come from working in the steel mills, which is not exactly a training
    ground for altar boys, but nothing prepared me or any of the others for
    these guys.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first sergeant was named Monteleone, and
    he was exceptionally vile. He referred to us singularly or en masse only as
    "you f---ing people." In some outfits, this rank is known as Top
    Sergeant, Top Kick or just Top, but in ours Monteleone was plain Sergeant to
    his face and anything derogatory we could think of behind his back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As bad as he was, there were a couple staff
    sergeants who gave him a run for his money at seeing who could be the most
    obscene. They not only swore constantly, but they insisted on telling us
    filthy stories, jokes, and reminiscences of their sexual conquests. I had
    heard dirty jokes and stories before this time but nothing like theirs. They
    were so crude they weren't even funny. One of the sergeants looked like he
    was continually hung over. The day after he returned from a pass, he would
    always tell us proudly "I got so drunk, I couldn't find my ass with
    both hands. I don't even remember where I was or what I did." Some of
    the men would laugh obligingly while others stood there in disbelief. Bapst,
    one of my new friends, always referred to him as "Sergeant Lush."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This does not imply the rest of us were
    angels. We all swore more in the Army than we did in civilian life, but
    compared to our new first sergeant and those "cadre members," as
    they liked to be called, we were babes in the woods. Where did these
    sergeants come from, I wondered? Were they the product of spending too much
    time in the Army? I hoped I would never find out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had four officers in our battery: Captain
    Mc Kee and Lieutenants Kraft, Engler (who came later in our training), and
    Harrison. We thought Engler was a pretty good guy, while we were neutral on
    the other two lieutenants until we got overseas, when things would change.
    From the very first day we were exposed to him, we drew the conclusion
    Captain McKee was a combination of a joke and a tragedy, all at the same
    time. He was about five feet four inches tall, and weighed about one hundred
    ten pounds. His uniform always looked like he had selected the smallest size
    available, but even then it was a size or two too big for him. It hung on
    him like a big brother hand-me-down. But it wasn't what he wore or how he
    looked that bothered us. It was what he said and did. We found out he had
    been an appliance salesman at the Boston Store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
    before the war and had risen in the military ranks through time spent in the
    National Guard. He walked-no strutted-around with a swagger stick under his
    arm, taking it out frequently to hold in his right hand and tap the open
    palm of his left hand. There was little effort on his part to hide his
    feeling of superiority over enlisted men. He lectured us constantly about
    how "the enlisted men should treat the officers with great
    respect." I had been taught respect is something that is earned, but
    here, it was being mandated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Mc Kee was very animated, but his theatrics
    were missing something. He was like a bad actor in a complex play, and like
    an audience, we were both embarrassed for him and disgusted at the same
    time. He instructed us daily on how to recognize the line that should never
    be crossed between the officers and enlisted men. What power he had over the
    enlisted men, and, oh, how he loved to use it, even on the most mundane
    issues. One example of this was his method of saluting. The procedure was
    for the enlisted man to salute the officer and hold the salute until the
    officer returned it. Most officers gave a quick and snappy response, but not
    McKee. He made sure the interval between the two salutes lasted as long as
    possible. It clearly conveyed the message: "I'll salute when I'm good
    and ready to do so and you can just sweat it out until I do." What
    vainglory!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Most commanding officers passed instructions
    about military courtesy to the enlisted men down through the ranks from
    their sub officers to the first sergeants and then to the men. But, Mc Kee
    enjoyed dispensing his version of these rules on a first-hand basis. While
    he had us in formation at attention, he would give rambling discourses about
    how he had stopped some enlisted man or men in or out of the camp for their
    infringement on military discipline. For example, he told the story about a
    GI who had stopped in a Jeep, given him a salute, and then asked for
    directions. He was "outraged" that the GI had not stepped out of
    the Jeep before approaching him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of the things Mc Kee said were really
    off the wall. One day while he had us together in formation, he asked,
    "Do any of you men use a washcloth while showering or an umbrella when
    it is raining?" He asked for hands, and many of us put ours up. By this
    time we were already sick of his nutty stories. We knew where he was going
    with this poll and, despite the fact we did not use those appliances, we
    wanted to be on the losing side just to get a rise out of him. He said:
    "I wish that I could get all of you with your hands up transferred out
    of his outfit because real men don't use washcloths or umbrellas." That
    little pipsqueak wouldn't know a good man if he saw one, and what in the
    world do umbrellas and washcloths have to do with soldiering? In reality, I
    doubt if there was a washcloth or umbrella in the whole camp, and if he was
    talking about civilian life, the question sounded even more bizarre. We were
    all hoping that he really meant it about the transfers because we would have
    taken him up on it in a minute.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another time, he made a big thing about how
    some enlisted men had "had the nerve" to move into the officers'
    seating section at the camp's movie theater. We were told later by men who
    had been there that the enlisted men's section had been full and there were
    several rows in the back of the officer's section that were not being used.
    "They won't do that again," Mc Kee stated with ferocity usually
    reserved for something really meaningful. We did not know what disciplinary
    action he took with the culprits, but we could imagine from his raving he
    would have liked to lock them up in the camp brig. We felt his overbearing
    reaction to insignificant things was the result of his lack of confidence
    because of his size and a cover for his incompetence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After being dismissed from a formation where
    we had to listen to one of these tirades by Mc Kee, one GI commented
    "If he puts his hand inside the front of his blouse, you can bet that
    that little bastard is Napoleon in reincarnation." Most of the enlisted
    men referred to Mc Kee behind his back as "ole bandy legs." I
    don't remember him having bowed legs, and I didn't think that the nickname
    was befitting. I thought it was too kind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As it turned out, when we got overseas, the
    only time we saw Captain Mc Kee was in convoys. He never came out to our gun
    positions. I guess he was too busy with paperwork back at headquarters. Our
    only revenge to his continuous put-downs, and it was a weak revenge, was to
    talk about him in private, which we did constantly but anything bad we could
    say about him would let him off too easily. What a jerk he was! We had all
    expected to be subjected to the military discipline of the army and to
    respect rank, but Mc Kee had a nasty way of rubbing our noses in it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      started to pick up and use one of the Army's most popular clichés: "How do 
      we get out of this chicken s--- outfit?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Both 
      Mc Kee and Monteleone were the constant subjects of our conversations. 
      None of it was favorable. What really surprised us about them came when we 
      learned over time they were antagonists. The first inkling came when we 
      heard from men who lived in the huts near the orderly room that they had 
      many arguments. We also picked up some unusual exchanges between them when 
      they had us in formation. We learned Mc Kee felt Monteleone's abrasive and 
      uncouth manner was not good military practice. While he respected his 
      complete control over us, he did not like the vulgar manner he used 
      continuously. Monteleone disliked Mc Kee primarily because Monteleone did 
      not like anybody. He thought Mc Kee was a weekend warrior who had received 
      his rank through the National Guard instead of coming up through the ranks 
      in the regular Army. Monteleone had been overheard at the PX one evening 
      when he had his fill of beer saying, "I know more about running a battery 
      than that f---ing excuse for a captain ever will." There was a noticeable 
      hostility between them that even we of the lowest rank could detect. The 
      way they spoke to each other, the looks of contempt, and the overreaction 
      to Mc Kee's commands by Monteleone were all too obvious.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">An 
      example of this animosity was highlighted one day after our normal duties 
      were completed. Mc Kee ordered Monteleone to take us to the parade ground 
      to do some close order drilling and calisthenics as punishment for some 
      infraction we had done during the day's routine. While Monteleone was 
      never shy about giving us extra duty, this day he wanted to do something 
      else and he said so to Mc Kee. Mc Kee replied that he wanted him 
      "personally" to take this assignment as he saw an opportunity to do two 
      things, punish the troops, and show his authority over 
      Monteleone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As 
      soon as we left the battery area, we were put into "route step." This was 
      unusual for Monteleone, who liked to keep us marching in cadence so he 
      could shout at those whom he thought were not doing it properly. We knew 
      something was up. When we got to the drill field, we expected to be given 
      a real workout. Instead, Monteleone put us at ease and proceeded to waste 
      time talking to one of his cadre members. After about half an hour, he 
      stepped out in front of us again and announced that we were now going to 
      start calisthenics. "Here it comes!" announced someone softly from the 
      rear of the ranks. We were all expecting the worst. Monteleone then 
      announced, "I want every man to extend his right arm straight out. Now in 
      cadence bring your index finger out on the count of one and in on the 
      count of two. One, two - one two, etc. This exercise is to strengthen your 
      trigger finger so you will be better riflemen." We were shocked to say the 
      least. Some men laughed, but Monteleone did not smile and the happy faces 
      turned sour. After about five minutes of this ridiculous maneuver, we were 
      marched back to our huts. As we neared the area, Monteleone brought us to 
      attention, raised his voice a few notches, and barked the marching orders 
      with new vigor. He was trying to convey the message to Mc Kee or any other 
      officers still in the area that he had really taken these troops out for a 
      real workout. When we were dismissed, there were a lot of mystified 
      soldiers. We later concluded the thing that made Monteleone happiest was 
      to show the troops he was not completely subjugated to Mc Kee.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      other officers in our battery, like all officers, had been 
      well-indoctrinated with the caste system of the Army that set out the vast 
      difference between the officers and enlisted men. There was no crossing 
      over the line between the two groups. Their authoritarian attitude left no 
      doubt they were part of a suppressive command that was to dominate the 
      enlisted men. They would occasionally engage us in small talk, but they 
      seldom acted like they had their hearts in it. They always gave us the 
      impression that, yes, they knew how to be sociable, but we shouldn't 
      forget they still gave the orders and we obeyed them. In hindsight, some 
      of their attitude may have had to do with the person directly over them in 
      command. They had to follow the directions and please an eccentric 
      captain, and they had to associate with him much more closely than we did. 
      For our part, the enlisted men met any fraternizing by the officers with 
      smiles of ready acceptance even though those, too, were not completely 
      earnest. We would become so firmly indoctrinated in military discipline we 
      felt we had to respond to authority, even to what could be construed as 
      phony social acceptance by this authority, with a favorable reception. We 
      knew it was not an earnest attempt on their part to develop any kind of 
      friendship, but we accepted any pleasantness as relief from the almost 
      constant barrage of orders they put upon us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We, 
      too, were playing at the game of pretense, and the smiles were mainly 
      phony on both sides. While we appeared to be engrossed in their every 
      word, our thoughts during these short sessions-and they usually were 
      short-were ones of apathy while our faces shone with approval. Anything we 
      could do to take some pressure off of us was worth doing a little acting. 
      We knew there was not going to be any kind of a lasting relationship to 
      come out of this because their officer's code forbade them from 
      socializing with us in off hours. There would be no three-day passes 
      together or even a glass of beer while sitting side by side at a bar in 
      the nearby town. And, so, the bridge between enlisted men and officers was 
      being built on a fallacious foundation that resulted in a strained 
      relationship between the two groups the entire time we were together in 
      the service.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      we were critical of the officers, we were also jealous of them; of the 
      privileges they enjoyed, the prestige involved, even the pay they 
      received. We were jealous of their dress uniforms with the hand-tailored 
      jackets, gray-pink pants, brass buttons, and, most important, those metal 
      symbols of power attached to their collars or set at the outer reaches of 
      their shoulders. In our periods of fanaticizing, we would gladly have 
      changed places with them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      the officers or cadre members gave us orders it was like a judge handing 
      down a sentence to a criminal, except there was no appeal process. Any 
      attempt to plead our cases or to even comment on them produced a harsh 
      reprimand. There was no excuse good enough for not obeying a command 
      instantly, no matter how implausible it might be. We were threatened with 
      dire consequences for "getting out of line." Penalties were swift and 
      usually were overkill for the infringement. The punishments would lead to 
      extra KP duty, cleaning the latrine, extra guard duty, walking around the 
      battalion area for hours wearing a full field pack, or being restricted to 
      the barracks. Later in our training, we would be threatened with how more 
      serious violations of something called The Articles of War would lead to 
      further discipline. The articles would include the phrases 
      "court-martial," "dishonorable discharge," "imprisonment," or even "death 
      by firing squad." It would be shock treatment at its worst and would knock 
      any semblance of resistance still remaining completely out of 
      us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      had all experienced discipline from our parents, teachers, and employers 
      before entering the service but nothing like this. We were now subject to 
      complete mind control with the requirement of immediate reaction to 
      commands and total subjugation to authority. In many cases, it appeared 
      they were more interested in degrading us than in teaching us anything 
      about military discipline. The aim of the discipline was to break our 
      wills to resist and to think on our own. To a great degree they succeeded. 
      All but a few of us soon learned to keep our mouths closed and follow 
      orders, even when they drove us beyond our normal physical endurance or 
      made no sense to us at all. We had to obey. We had to accept their ways, 
      and we could not question. But, in the back of our minds, we knew we were 
      civilians at heart, and we would only have to endure these inequities for 
      a given length of time. The war would not last forever, and we would 
      eventually be free of this caste system.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Many 
      years after the war, a movie came out that included a great line which 
      really condensed the feelings we had as enlisted men in the United States 
      Army. It stated, "The Army is in the business of defending democracy, not 
      practicing it."1</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A few 
      men still had minds of their own even after our training period resulted 
      in the rest of us being beaten into subjective sheep. They regularly 
      challenged the high-ranking noncoms and tested the officers' 
      decision-making process. Then those in charge decided on one of two 
      alternatives. Was the violation serious enough for a court martial or 
      should it be met with some kind of severe penalty right there in the 
      battery? While the rest of us often griped about our conditions, we 
      avoided confrontation authority figures.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      first two months after we arrived in camp were considered basic training. 
      During that time, they kept us busy six days a week from sun up to sun 
      down. Then there was a gradual reduction until our schedule was changed to 
      five and a half days a week, with the evening meal signaling the end of 
      the day Monday through Friday and the parade on Saturday. However, that 
      did not mean all duties stopped for everybody at those times. There were 
      often special assignments like KP, guard duty, penalty duties, and night 
      operations thrown in to keep us on edge.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      there was no typical day at Camp Haan, every day started the same at 0600. 
      Sergeant Monteleone awakened us for first call as he walked down the 
      street between the huts with his mouth spewing one-liners like an open 
      sewer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Out 
      of those fart sacks, you f---ing people!" "Drop your c---s and grab your 
      socks!" "Strike those tents!" "Off your a-- and on your feet."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On 
      the way back to the orderly room, he would stop at certain huts, bang the 
      screen doors open and shut a few times as loudly as he could, and shout at 
      anyone still in bed, with all his shouts peppered with obscenities and 
      dirty expressions only he thought clever. The first thing we did was to 
      pull on our shoes and fatigue pants. We grabbed our shaving gear and 
      hurried down to the latrine in hopes of beating some of the crowd. There, 
      we shaved, washed, showered, and used the toilet facilities. Returning to 
      our huts, we finished dressing, made our bed, and straightened up the 
      huts. As part of dressing, we had to lace up our cloth 
leggings.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      0630, one of the staff sergeants would come down the street continually 
      yelling, "Fall out!" to get us out of our huts and into formation for roll 
      call. Monteleone would be standing out in the street facing the place we 
      were to line up in formation. He would be shouting at a constant cadence, 
      "Fall in! Fall in!" We would mumble to ourselves, "OK, which is it, fall 
      in or fall out?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      lined up in two groups with each representing a platoon. Each group had 
      four rows, each row being a fifteen-man gun section. We stood there in our 
      prescribed location but not at attention. When everyone was in place, 
      Monteleone, who was still standing facing us, would shout, "Atteeen hut!" 
      and we would all snap to attention. There were more shouts of "Straighten 
      those lines!" and "Get that straggler's name." (a euphemism for, "Make 
      sure that guy gets extra KP duty!") He then yelled, "Call the 
      roll!"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Roll 
      call consisted of each of us responding "Here!" in a voice that was loud 
      enough to be heard a block away when our name was called. The section 
      leader took roll call for each gun section, and they in turn reported to 
      the platoon sergeant. The two platoon sergeants would then take turns 
      shouting to the first sergeant, "All present and accounted for!" After 
      both platoons responded, Monteleone would do a 180 degree pivot, salute, 
      and give his report to the Officer of the Day who had come out of the 
      orderly room during roll call and had been standing behind him. Monteleone 
      would then turn back to us, expound a couple of obscenity-laced threats, 
      then yell, "Dismissed!" And so, our day would start with the melodious 
      voice of the little dictator ringing in our ears. Then it was back to the 
      huts and wait for breakfast to be served.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">About 
      fifteen minutes after being dismissed from formation, one of the cooks 
      would stick his head out of the mess hall and shout, "Chow call!" at the 
      top of his voice, and we would head to the mess hall to stand in line 
      before entering. If you were really hungry, you lined up before the call 
      so you would be near the front. There were three full meals a day that 
      most of us looked forward to with great anticipation. Army food was high 
      in starch and everyone, including me, put on weight despite the great 
      amount of physical activity we were doing. When we entered the mess hall, 
      we picked up plates and silverware. The food was spooned out of large 
      cooking pans by the cooks who filled our plates as we passed them. We then 
      sat at wooden picnic tables to eat. We always picked a buddy or two to sit 
      with during the meal.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      person in charge of the mess hall was Staff Sergeant Frank Emerling. In 
      civilian life, he had been a chef at a major hotel in Los Angeles. He was 
      really good at his trade, and when he was around we ate well-prepared 
      food. However, Emerling had one propensity, which turned out to be a 
      detriment to us as well as to himself. He hated the Army with such a 
      passion that he would go AWOL a lot and be punished with the loss of his 
      stripes. No matter who took his place, the quality of the food would 
      deteriorate badly. It was amazing to see the change in the quality of 
      meals we got, even though the rations going into the kitchen remained 
      about the same. For example, without Emerling on duty, beef would be 
      served only as hamburger or stew meat and the desert would go from 
      homemade sheet cake with chocolate frosting to fruit cocktail out of a 
      can. It did not take long for the officers, who ate with us but at 
      separate tables, to tire of the second-rate food, and Emerling would be 
      back in charge of the kitchens with his staff sergeant rank restored. That 
      sequence happened three times in the course of our training and then again 
      when we were overseas. We kidded him about having zippers on his stripes 
      to make them easy to remove and put back on again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      finishing our first meal of the day, we picked up our dishes, scraped them 
      into garbage cans, and stacked them for the KPs to wash later. We then 
      went back to the huts or to the latrine for last-minute 
cleanup.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      0715, to the sergeant's command of "Fall out," we lined up in formation 
      out in the street again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Every 
      morning, at this first formation after breakfast, anyone who was sick or 
      felt something was wrong with him would be told to assemble in front of 
      the battery office, called the Orderly Room. Their names would be entered 
      in the sick book. Later, these men would be marched to the dispensary to 
      be inspected by a doctor or a medic. The procedure was referred to as sick 
      call. Out of the five or six guys who reported being sick, several would 
      be there almost every day. Their malady usually consisted of something not 
      readily discernible to the medics. A common one was, "I have this awful 
      pain in my back." They knew back pain were hard to detect and even harder 
      to treat, so they could come back tomorrow with the same ailment. These 
      men were known as the goof-offs of the outfit who would do anything to get 
      out of a day's work. I don't remember anyone in our gun crew ever going on 
      sick call because we were all in the best physical condition we had ever 
      been in. Also, there were some horror stories going around about the 
      dispensing of medicines by medics who flunked out of medical school. They 
      were probably rumors started by the sergeants to discourage us from going 
      there. Anyone who worked in the dispensary, regardless of rank, was called 
      a pill pusher.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Following sick call, we did calisthenics, which 
      usually took about half an hour. The sergeant would spread us out in the 
      formation by calling us to attention, ordering "right shoulder arms," and 
      then putting us at ease again. The workout usually consisted of arm 
      exercises, deep knee bends, jumping jacks, and push-ups. Occasionally, the 
      sergeant in charge would get lazy and limit the calisthenics to 
      stretching. After they were done, we had to police the area. We lined up 
      across one end of our campsite and then walked through the area in one 
      straight line, picking up everything that did not belong there. The 
      sergeants would be behind us to point out anything we missed. They even 
      had a vulgar expression to "encourage" us to bend over and pick up 
      everything. "I want to see nothing but a-- holes and elbows." We soon 
      became use to their immorality so any shock value began to lose its 
      effect. "Don't all high-ranking sergeants talk like that?" we asked 
      ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b 
      >Getting Down To Basics</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      0800, the workday would begin.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      first thing they taught us in our training was how to salute, march in 
      formation, and to do close order drill. We marched all over camp doing 
      many different maneuvers. The drill sergeant, who was usually one of the 
      cadre members, would be shouting out in cadence; "Hut, …, hut, …, hut, 
      two, three, four, hut, hut, … by the right flank …march, by the left flank 
      …march, to the rear march, column left …march, column right …march, detail 
      … halt …parade rest." Then there were other comments they would give 
      during the marching like, "Close it up!" "Straighten those lines!" "Get 
      the lead out!" "What's the matter with you!" "Pick up your ass!" and "You 
      look like a bunch of old ladies!" The command we hated the most was, 
      "Double time …march!" which consisted of going from a marching cadence to 
      running in a faster one. Usually, a sergeant would take us out on the 
      streets, march us around for an hour or so and then double time us back to 
      the battery area. We began to hear these commands and comments in our 
      sleep.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were taught exactly how and what to wear for what they called, the uniform 
      of the day. It was one of three types: fatigues, khakis, or dress ODs (See 
      Figs. 21b, 22, 23a, 23b,and 23c). We wore fatigues during the day except 
      on Saturdays when we paraded. In the evening and on Sundays, we wore our 
      khakis or the olive drab dress uniform, depending on the weather. The 
      dress code made everyone looked exactly the same at any given time. There 
      was no room for individuality.<br></font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      was no mixing of uniforms and any deviation would result in a shout from 
      some sergeant, "You're out of uniform, soldier." Whenever they called you 
      "soldier," you knew you were somehow out of line. Every piece of clothing 
      had to be done up as described in some Army manual. Certain buttons were 
      to be buttoned while others were not, the pants were to be tucked into and 
      bloused over the leggings in a prescribed manner, the ties on our dress 
      uniforms were to be tied with a single loop and folded into the shirts 
      between two specific buttons, and the list went on. Even the overseas caps 
      that went with our dress uniforms had to sit on our heads in a prescribed 
      location. They were to be cocked to the right, and the front end set 
      one-inch above the right eyebrow. These hats had a red cord piped around 
      the top edge designating artillery. The cadre members had a profane name 
      for this article of clothing that is too vulgar to repeat.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">For 
      everything we did, there was the right way, the wrong way, and the Army 
      way. Only the Army way counted. We were taught when to and how to speak to 
      officers and noncoms. We were even instructed on how to strip and dispose 
      of the butts from cigarettes: to open the paper, scatter the tobacco, roll 
      the paper into a tiny ball, then throw it on the ground.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Every 
      day we spent a lot of time on aircraft identification. If we were going to 
      shoot down aircraft, we had better know the enemy from our own. Because no 
      one knew at the time where they would be sent to following our training, 
      we had to study planes from both the European and Pacific theaters of 
      operation. There were American, British, Canadian, German, Japanese, 
      Italian, and Russian planes, both fighters and bombers. We used movies, 
      flash cards (See Fig. 24) and models to learn the characteristics of all 
      the warplanes being used at that time.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Messerschmitt Flash Card" src="images/Messerschmitt_Flash_Card_3_24.jpg" width="500" height="229" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Despite the constant drill on this subject, some men 
      never seemed to become proficient in identifying planes. They could not 
      even distinguish between a fighter and a bomber. That bothered me but 
      nothing was ever done about it other than to repeat the identification 
      drills over and over again. I became convinced this lack of knowledge 
      could cause serious problems if we got into a combat situation. Would 
      there be time to take a vote if we were attacked? Was I the only one 
      worried about this? Because I had been studying planes since I was in 
      grammar school, I stood out in this area. I soon became the one who did 
      the testing and grading of the other soldiers in our outfit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      1200 hours, we were back at the mess hall for lunch or what the Army 
      called dinner. It would be the main meal of the day. Then, it was back 
      into formation where we were marched off to continue our 
      training.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      went to the gun park where we fieldstripped the 40mm guns to determine how 
      they operated and learned the official names of the many parts. There was 
      a drill to see how fast we could lower the gun from its traveling position 
      to a firing position and then a reverse of that procedure. (See Figs. 25a 
      and 25b) We took the breechblock out so many times it all became very 
      routine. More about the 40mm and some of our other equipment was taught 
      with lectures and movies back in the day room. Manuals were studied and we 
      were tested on how well we memorized the nomenclature of major 
      items.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="40mm antiaircraft gun in firing position" src="images/40mm_Gun_Firing_Position_3_25a.jpg" width="494" height="341" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As a 
      Battalion, we were taken to the camp's obstacle course where we jumped 
      over wooden fences, swung by ropes over ditches, crawled through pipe, and 
      climbed knotted ropes. There was always some kind of a mythical record we 
      were trying to break as a battalion which was to spur us on to be faster 
      and better than other battalions. While the sergeants tried to transfer 
      their enthusiasm for breaking the record to us recruits, we somehow never 
      got that excited about it. To us it was just a lot of hard work and our 
      main goal was to get it over with as soon as possible with the least 
      amount of pain.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="40mm antiaircraft gun in traveling position" src="images/40mm_Gun_Firing_Position_3_25b.jpg" width="494" height="261" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A lot 
      of time was spent learning about the M-l .30 caliber Garand rifles we had 
      been issued. They taught us how to carry it in formations, field strip it, 
      put it back together, and maintain it. We even had to disassemble and 
      assemble it blindfolded. The gun could be loaded with a clip with eight 
      rounds, and it fired semi-automatic. That meant you had to pull the 
      trigger for each shot. We learned something called the manual of arms, 
      which is the rigid movement of the rifle to different positions while we 
      were in formation. It included saluting, carrying, moving it to a shoulder 
      position and back to the ground among other movements. There was no 
      ammunition issued for the rifles until later when we had target 
      practice.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were issued bayonets and learned how to attach them to the rifle and use 
      them as weapons. There were classes in jabbing with the bayonets, hitting 
      with the butt of the rifle, and other ways of inflicting bodily injury to 
      the enemy. The training was intended to create a martial attitude that 
      would make us more ferocious warriors. We moved</font> <font size="3" 
      face=Arial>through the drills with intensity, but 
      somehow it did not make a lot of sense to most of us. In our view, the 
      chances of an antiaircraft crewman having to fight the enemy hand-to-hand 
      seemed quite remote. There was no effort made to sharpen our bayonets and 
      no thought given to them after the drill. They went back in their 
      scabbards where they remained for the balance of the war and, like the gas 
      masks, became just another piece of equipment added to the load we carried 
      everywhere we went. Later, the bayonet's main function would turn out to 
      be as a tool for opening wooden cartons and ration cans. Most of us 
      believed if you got close enough to the enemy to use a bayonet, shoot him 
      instead.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Learning to use gas masks was one of the most 
      disliked chapters of our training. We were sent into a building and all 
      doors and windows were closed. Then, they set off tear gas bombs while our 
      masks were still in their carrying pouches. After the discharge, we had to 
      hold our breath, open the gas mask container, put the mask on, and clear 
      the mask to avoid being affected by the gas. Not everyone was successful, 
      and there were some violent reactions from those who had not done it in 
      time. One fellow in our unit had a temporary breakdown from his experience 
      and had to be sent to the hospital for several days. We carried these gas 
      masks every day we were training and when we got overseas. It was a real 
      pain in the neck lugging them around, and we soon learned to hate them. 
      What we were not told, but should have been, was the reason for the 
      emphasis on everyone carrying a gas mask at all times, at least in a 
      combat zone.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i 
        >During World War I there had been heavy casualties 
        on both sides from the use of poison gasses. During World War I there 
        were 1,296,853 casualties from chemical warfare gasses, 91,198 died.<sup 
        >2</sup></i></font></p></blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">This 
      information would have made carrying the masks a lot easier to tolerate. 
      However, the Army was not out to offer us justifications for what they 
      were doing, only to set rules and force us to obey them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      were lectures and films in the day room. The films were primarily about 
      our equipment, aircraft identification, military procedures, health, and 
      military discipline. The films always seemed to come on the hottest days, 
      and we were shut in the day room with all of the windows closed so the 
      shades could be pulled to darken the room. There was no problem keeping 
      our attention, despite the hot and stuffy room, because the sergeants were 
      right there to make sure we stayed awake.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">One 
      series of films I enjoyed, Why We Fight<sup>3</sup>, 
      was produced by one of Hollywood's best directors of that time, Frank 
      Capra. It was intended to be an indoctrination film for new recruits, and 
      it was American propaganda at its best. It was a powerful documentation of 
      recent history and presented convincing evidence why we were fighting a 
      just war. The films depicted the United States as a diversified nation 
      with lofty ideals joining together with the Allied Nations to engage the 
      dictatorial tyrants of the Axis countries.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      were seven one-hour series and we would be shown a new chapter about once 
      a month. The first three - Prelude to War, The Nazis Strike, and Divide 
      and Conquer - showed the rise of the totalitarian governments, Germany, 
      Italy and Japan, and their ruthless conquering and oppression of neutral 
      countries. It was exciting entertainment and a great improvement over most 
      of the dull training films we were exposed to. The next three chapters - 
      Battle of Britain, The Battle of Russia, and The Battle of China - 
      depicted the Allied powers making progress as the Axis countries began to 
      go on the defense. The final chapter - War Comes to America- was more 
      political and purely propaganda oriented, showing the folly of having our 
      country follow an isolation policy like we did after World War I, which 
      the film partially blames for causing World War II.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      were many emotional and exciting episodes in these series. Some of the 
      best footage was taken from Nazi films captured by the Allied Army. There 
      was one scene in this vein that really stuck in my mind for a long period 
      of time. It showed Hitler, Goering and other high-ranking German officials 
      standing around a large wooden table covered with maps celebrating the 
      surrender of France. Hitler and Goering were bouncing around the room like 
      a couple of kids in a candy store while Goering was wringing his hands 
      gleefully. If it wasn't such a serious matter, the scene could be part of 
      a Hollywood comedy with grown men acting like children. I looked forward 
      to each successive chapter of that series and I learned a lot about 
      history, propaganda tainted or not. To me the series was entertainment, 
      because it was a relief from our daily grind. I already knew Hitler and 
      his like were the enemy, so the main purpose of the films in motivating me 
      to go charging out and get him was lost somewhere.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were also shown sex hygiene films about what happened if we contracted a 
      social disease. The films were really gross, and for the most part they 
      scared the majority of us into behaving ourselves. I glanced around the 
      room during one very graphic scene and about half of the men in the room 
      were grimacing. The threat of a court martial for anyone who contracted a 
      disease also loomed over our heads. To make sure we had not contracted one 
      of these diseases, they regularly gave us a physical inspection. About 
      once a month, they would have us all fall out into formation in front of 
      our huts wearing a raincoat, shoes, a helmet liner and nothing else. The 
      raincoats were rubberized, guaranteeing we would be sweating profusely 
      after a short period of time from the heat of the California sun. We would 
      then be marched over to the medics building, lined up and, with our 
      raincoats opened, our genitals inspected by a medic sitting on a chair in 
      front of us. He would look for social diseases, crabs, or something worse. 
      It was known as short arm inspection.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >According to army regulations, once a month we were 
      to be read the Articles of War, the Army's criminal code governing our 
      actions while in service. We referred to them as the commandments, only 
      these rules left no room for contrition, only punishment. Any infringement 
      of these laws could lead to a court-martial with the resulting penalties. 
      For example, they stated we could not be absent without authorized leave 
      (AWOL), desert, fail to obey an order, be drunk on duty, show disrespect 
      for a commissioned officer, disobey a noncommissioned officer and so on. 
      We always got a kick out of the last Article. It stated, in effect, if 
      your conduct was of a nature to bring disrespect upon the Army, you could 
      be subject to a court-martial. This meant anything you did not to the 
      Army's liking could be included in their list of crimes. It was a catchall 
      if I ever heard one, and I wondered why they bothered to be so specific 
      about some infringements when this one covered them all.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Those 
      in charge of our training would throw out the threat of court-martial on a 
      regular basis. It was presented in such a forceful manner the mere thought 
      sent fear through us. There could be the court-martial itself, maybe a 
      dishonorable discharge, and even time in jail. While much of their 
      blustering was little more than threats, we did not know that at the time, 
      and if we did, we did not want to take the chance of being made an 
      example. If they treated any minor infringement with major punishments, 
      surely they would follow through with the threats associated with more 
      serious items outlined in the Articles of War. Most soldiers like me lived 
      under the threat of court-martial and we went to great pains to avoid 
      one.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      were many hikes that took us out of camp. The army called them forced 
      marches. We wondered why they used the word forced to describe these 
      activities. Everything we did was forced on us, so why limit it to 
      marches? We carried a full field pack on a few of them, but on most we 
      just wore our fatigues with gun belts, helmet liners, and gas masks and 
      carried our rifles. Some hikes were as short as five miles; others were as 
      long as twenty-five miles. On the longer hikes, we would get a ten-minute 
      break every hour to sit down on the ground and rest. The sergeant in 
      charge would shout out, "Take a ten-minute break, smoke if you've got em." 
      Most of the fellows smoked. After the ten minutes were up, the sergeant 
      would yell out, "Okay, men, on you feet, stow those butts, and move it 
      out," and we would be off again as men field stripped their cigarettes. 
      The longer hikes really tested our endurance. Just like they did at the 
      obstacle course, they would pit one battery against another, platoon 
      against platoon, and even gun section against gun section. It was a 
      contest who would finish first, who would finish in the least amount of 
      time, and who would have the most men finish the longer hikes. Like the 
      contests at the obstacle course, winning was a lot more important to the 
      officers and noncoms than it was to the rest of us. The younger men would 
      usually take over carrying the rifles of the older ones in order to 
      lighten their load in hopes they could stay the course and finish the 
      hike. A Jeep or a weapons carrier followed the hikers and picked up 
      stragglers who could not finish. The sergeants tried to make those who 
      fell out feel as guilty as possible for letting down their 
unit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Sometimes, while marching around on the streets in 
      the camp, we would come across Italian prisoners of war doing labor work. 
      They had been captured by the American Army in the battle for North Africa 
      and incarcerated in an area located in the far corner of Camp Haan. The 
      men of Italian descent in our outfit would greet the prisoners with the 
      well-known stiff-arm salute: They grabbed the inside of their right 
      forearm with the left hand and then propelled both arms up in the air. It 
      was always followed with some kind of an oath in Italian only they 
      understood. Even though the rest of us did not know the meaning of what 
      was said, just listening to the emphasis put on certain words and watching 
      the body language produced a lot of laughs from our ranks while the 
      prisoners just smiled without a response.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      bivouacked in open fields outside Camp Haan for several days. There we 
      were introduced to pup tent living (See Fig. 26). The first night out it 
      rained, which was rare for southern California, and we soon learned how to 
      dig small drainage ditches around the tent to avoid getting flooded out. 
      At first we found it all quite exciting, but later we would learn to 
      dislike it because of their cramped quarters.. Our meals were delivered by 
      truck and we ate out of mess kits for the first time.</font></p>
      <p><img border="1" alt="Bob Gallagher next to pup tent - bivouac" src="images/Pup_Tent_Bob_Gallagher_Bivouac_3_26.jpg" width="433" height="566" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Back 
      at Camp Haan, we grumbled among ourselves about the rigorous training, 
      never realizing that it was going to get much worse. Our complaining was 
      somewhat tempered by the fact that there were branches of the Army which 
      were a lot harder and potentially more dangerous than an anti-aircraft 
      outfit. Nobody expected military life to be fun, and, realistically, it 
      was just what we anticipated it to be: hard, miserable, and demeaning. 
      There was little talk about when the war is over because the way military 
      operations were going overseas, we knew that the end was a long way down 
      the road.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On a 
      regular basis, we were taken over to the camp's infirmary and given 
      tetanus, typhoid, and smallpox shots. While standing in line to be shot, 
      there were always men who would exaggerate about what was going to happen. 
      "Watch out for the square needles." Someone coming out of the infirmary 
      would hold up their fingers to indicate the needles being used inside were 
      all of six-inches long. There were always a few men who would faint from 
      the shots and we all had some discomfort from them. One shot produced 
      immediate pain, but it went away after several hours. The next day, the 
      effects of another shot kicked in and caused some discomfort that lasted 
      for about twenty-four more hours. After repeating the procedure several 
      times, we began to take it all in stride.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Every 
      Saturday morning at 1000 hours we had an inspection of quarters by an 
      officer. To get ready, we would start the evening before, scrubbing and 
      readying our hut and everything in it for the big moment. Our bunks were 
      made up in a prescribed method with square corners and OD blankets pulled 
      tight. We put on our newest uniform that was well cleaned and pressed. Our 
      shoes were given a heavy coat of polish, brushed, and buffed to a high 
      gloss shine with a soft cloth. As the officer approached the screen door, 
      a cadre member would shout out, "Attention!" loud enough to wake the dead. 
      We would all stiffen into a rigid position of attention next to our cots 
      as the officer and sergeant entered; there we would remain the entire time 
      they were in our hut. The officer would always find something wrong, and 
      made a big fuss about it. The sergeant would make notes of every 
      shortcoming; extra duties were passed out as penalties in some cases. No 
      matter how we tried, it was nearly impossible to meet the standards 
      required of us. We soon learned to do our best and then care less about 
      being perfect. While they threatened severe consequences, such as 
      eliminating passes for a weekend, that was usually a bluff unless there 
      was some flagrant goof-up. We kidded among ourselves that perhaps they 
      would send us back to civilian life for being inept, but we knew that was 
      not likely.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      all the huts were inspected, we lined up on the street, standing at rigid 
      attention and in formation, where our dress uniforms and M-1 rifles went 
      through further inspection. The night before, the rifles had been cleaned 
      meticulously, the metal parts lightly oiled, and the walnut stock polished 
      with linseed oil. The officer would come down the line of men, all with 
      the butts of their rifles on the ground tight against their bodies. As the 
      officer stopped in front of him, each man would bring the rifle up to port 
      arms and then open the bolt, all in a rigid military movement. The officer 
      would bring his hand up from his side, like a boxer throwing an uppercut, 
      and grab the rifle out of the man's hands. If you didn't let go of it in 
      time you were in big trouble. The officer would inspect the rifle, even 
      looking down the barrel. "You call this clean? This rifle is filthy. How 
      long have you been in the Army, soldier? Sergeant, take this man's name. 
      Next time, I want to see this rifle sparkle." Following each mans 
      inspection the rifle was thrown back to him; he closed the bolt and, by 
      rigid movements, put it back on the ground. The questions and comments by 
      the officer varied from man to man, but they all had one theme-we were not 
      up to his expectations.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Following inspection on Saturday, all the troops 
      would go out on the parade ground and pass in review before the high 
      command of the camp while a band played stirring military music. It may 
      sound corny today, but at the time, it was a big thrill to be a part of 
      this and I, for one, looked forward to it. It somehow made me proud to be 
      a soldier. Because I am tall, I was made the guidon carrier for our 
      battery. The guidon is a small flag designating which unit you are in. It 
      was attached to the top of a ten-foot-long wooden pole. I marched ahead 
      and to the right side of the formation by myself. Because of the large 
      number of men in the battery and the band playing, not everyone could hear 
      the commands from the officer leading our unit. The men would watch the 
      guidon and react to the signals I would send them. For example, as we 
      passed the reviewing stand, I dropped the pole, on command, from a 
      vertical to a horizontal position. That indicated everyone except the left 
      column of men should look to the right, toward the stand. When the flag 
      went back up, we all looked straight ahead. The reviewing stand was a 
      rickety-looking structure made of the same materials that everything else 
      in camp was made of: plywood and two-by-fours. It looked like it was made 
      by men who volunteered as carpenters even though they had never held a 
      hammer before they entered service. Half a dozen or so high ranking 
      officers were standing on it doing their best at looking 
      important.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were told the reviewing committee rated us on the quality of our marching, 
      the straightness of our lines, and the military snap of our movements. We 
      assumed our battalion never won because nobody in authority ever brought 
      the subject up after the parade was over. Because we were not interested 
      in the results, we never bothered to ask how we did.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As 
      the training continued, many things became easier to take. We began to 
      move the thoughts of civilian life out of our minds and accept army life 
      as the norm. The strenuous life we were leading and the authoritarian 
      administration of our activities by the likes of Sergeant Monteleone and 
      the cadre members were taken as a matter of course. Thoughts of family and 
      civilian friends became less frequent until they became something rare. 
      When we thought about the future, it was about what the Army had in store 
      for us tomorrow, not wondering when we were going home.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With 
      all of the physical exercises we were doing, our bodies were made hard and 
      we were all in much better shape than when we first arrived at Camp Haan. 
      We looked at the end of each day with great expectation, glad to have some 
      time to ourselves. Sometimes it was relief from physical exertion; 
      sometimes from boredom created by the repetition of dull routine.</font> 
      <font size="3" face="Arial">Supper at 1800 hours was 
      always enjoyable because it usually signaled the end of the working 
      day.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      supper, we would stand around the orderly room and the battery clerk would 
      pass out the mail. We were always glad to hear from a friend or relative. 
      Those who had left a wife or steady girlfriend behind were especially 
      anxious to get letters from them. There were a few men who seemed to get 
      much more mail than anyone else, and they took a lot of kidding about it. 
      Then there were others who got packages frequently. We always hoped that 
      the recipient of the package was in our hut because we expected him to 
      share his gift with us. Most packages contained cookies or homemade candy. 
      Some of the goodies were so stale they were hard to eat, but we did 
      anyway.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >During free evenings, there wasn't much to do in 
      camp. The movie theater showed only one feature, which changed once a 
      week. While we were constantly standing in lines for everything we did, 
      the lines for getting into the theater were the longest. It took a lot of 
      fun out of it but we soon learned to get there at the off-peak hour. One 
      of the movies I saw was Two Girls and a Sailor with June Allyson, Gloria 
      De Haven, and Frank Sinatra. There was a lot of talk among my fellow GIs 
      about why Sinatra was not in the service but of much more interest to me 
      were the two girls who played the leads. I dreamed about them for months 
      after.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      PX got a lot of play. It was a combination of a drug store, ice cream 
      parlor, and tavern. It was always the most crowded during the week or so 
      after payday and only those who arrived early were able to get seats. On 
      the days just before payday, there were all kinds of seats available. One 
      section of the PX sold toilet articles, candy, stationery, and items like 
      that. Another area was set up as an ice cream parlor, and the third 
      section sold beer (no wine or hard liquor). The two beers sold there were 
      named Lucky Lager and ABC. There was no sign of Schlitz or Budweiser, the 
      popular civilian beers of the time. The PX beer was called 3-2, that meant 
      it had 3.2 percent alcohol content. This was somewhat less than the amount 
      in beer sold in civilian bars. Despite the low alcohol content, most 
      soldiers who spent the evening in the beer area-including me at 
      times-started off talking among ourselves in normal voices and wound up in 
      more boisterous. In the early hours we would discuss the days activities 
      and damn the officers and high-ranking noncoms. As the night progressed, 
      the noise became louder and you had to shout to be understood. The smoke 
      in the room got progressively thicker, the conversations more bawdy, and 
      the laughs earsplitting. Near the end of the evening, we would have our 
      arms around each other singing songs at the top of our voices. <i 
      >Roll out the Barrel </i>and <i 
      >Bless 'em All</i> were two favorites. Always included 
      and often repeated was the racier, <i>Roll Me Over In 
      The Clover</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Going 
      back to our barracks we would be acting drunk, complete with staggering 
      steps. I say acting, because most of us were in our late teens, and 
      drinking was relatively new to us. We usually drank about four or five 
      beers in an evening, and would act like we had just polished off a fifth 
      of gin. No one could possibly get that drunk on the equivalent of two or 
      three bottles of regular beer. It was all part of our growing up. We were 
      all trying to shed the image of raw recruits-young boys and untrained 
      civilians. Every effort was made to act more like seasoned soldiers. 
      Drinking beer and getting drunk at the PX was how some of the men showed 
      how tough they were getting. Others were just drowning their sorrows while 
      still others, like me, tried the heavy drinking a few times, got sick from 
      it, and settled down to having a few bottles of the 3-2 beer with my 
      buddies as a social thing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">About 
      every two weeks, I would get KP duty. While it was hard work, it was a 
      change in pace and I looked forward to it even with the threat of cleaning 
      the grease-traps hanging over me. I got to eat better than normal. If 
      there were a good dessert that day, I would have second or third helpings. 
      It didn't take much to make me happy in those days.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Another assignment delegated on a regular basis was 
      guard duty. It would usually last for twenty-four hours. I would be 
      assigned to a special barracks known as the guardhouse. There we were 
      inspected and instructed in our assignment by a duty officer. Every other 
      four-hour period I would be driven in a Jeep to some prescribed site to 
      stand guard. There, I would walk around the motor pool, guard a remote 
      gate in the camp, or be assigned to a site where I had no idea why I was 
      needed. While not on duty, I would hang around the guardhouse talking to 
      other men or trying to catch some sleep. I carried my rifle on guard duty 
      but I did not have ammunition for it. If I was ever challenged by anyone 
      with serious confrontational intentions, I wasn't sure what I was supposed 
      to do about it because nobody ever brought up the subject. I suppose the 
      options were to wrestle them to the ground or run and shout out for help. 
      While the last one sounds more logical, I was usually in such a remote 
      location shouting could not be heard by anyone. Sometimes, the four-hour 
      shift would be in the middle of the night and the duty officer who came 
      around infrequently would remind me of the dire consequences-read court 
      martial-if I fell asleep at a post.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I was 
      given a real test in staying awake one night when I was assigned guard 
      duty at a ward in the camp hospital. The patients were American soldiers 
      who had been either accused or convicted of some crime and had been in the 
      Camp Haan stockade, either doing time, waiting for their court martial, or 
      waiting to be transferred to Fort Leavenworth prison to do time there for 
      a major crime. These men were temporarily assigned to a special section of 
      the hospital for medical and psychological problems. The term 
      psychological problem was never explained to me, but it had an ominous 
      ring to it. I was supposed to keep them from escaping, although this would 
      have been quite difficult to do if they had made any real attempt. Without 
      ammunition, my rifle would have been useless, and I had visions of 
      wrestling on the floor with some loony who was in there for murder or 
      worse.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      patients were in a large ward with ten beds along each side of the room. 
      The ward was even more sterile-looking than the inside of our huts, if 
      that was possible. It had the unmistakable smell of antiseptic. The walls 
      and ceiling were painted white, the floor was an off-white tile, and the 
      patients' gowns and the bedding were all white. There was nothing in the 
      room other than beds. The windows had no drapes, curtains, or Venetian 
      blinds. Both the windows and the glass part of the door behind me were 
      covered with a heavy-gauge steel mesh.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I was 
      assigned to stand guard at the only exit to the room, and there was a 
      small folding-chair for me to sit on. It was the only chair in the room. 
      Looking down the long hall away from the ward, I could neither hear nor 
      see anyone, and that gave me a very lonely feeling. The ward was locked 
      from the outside, which meant I could not get out if I wanted to. I looked 
      around for a phone but there was none. It would have been difficult, if 
      not impossible, to get assistance in an emergency. What in the hell are 
      they thinking? I thought. It had not escaped my notice whenever a nurse 
      came into the area, two MPs armed with .45 caliber pistols accompanied 
      her, and I bet they were loaded. At about ten o'clock that night, someone 
      I could not see turned off all of the lights except two small lamps 
      hanging on each side of the door. I didn't even have control over the 
      lights. One of the prisoners sat up and dropped his feet over the side of 
      the bed. I thought he was going to get up, and I was sure there was going 
      to be an encounter as he kept giving me dirty looks while he mumbled, "You 
      think you're tough?" over and over again. I was much relieved when he lay 
      back down and seemed to fall asleep like the others.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      was extremely difficult to sit there in the dim light watching twenty men 
      sleeping; most of them snoring so loudly it reverberated off the walls. I 
      had to pace around the end of the room and keep slapping myself in the 
      face to keep from falling asleep myself. I had to slap harder as time 
      progressed, and my face smarted from the blows. The good thing was as long 
      as they were asleep, I did not have to worry about them escaping. My shift 
      was for four hours, but it seemed like an eternity. In the middle of the 
      night my replacement showed up, and I was greatly relieved to see him. I 
      tried to explain the unique problems associated with this duty to the 
      sergeant who drove me back to the guard barrack in a Jeep. He listened to 
      my story as though he was interested and then replied, "That's tough s--- 
      soldier. Tell it to the chaplain."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Another time, I was assigned to a small guardhouse on 
      a remote road that led into the camp. I had been warned by some fellow GIs 
      who had that duty before me there was nothing going on there. To pass the 
      time, they recommended I take some live ammunition and spend the lonely 
      hours doing target practice with my M-1 rifle. Although we were not 
      supposed to have ammunition, somehow it was always available. I found some 
      without looking too hard.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Before it got dark, I decided to use up the eight 
      round clip I brought with me. On my first shot, I killed a bird standing 
      on the ground about 200 feet away, and then I realized two things. While 
      standing there looking at the bird's head dangling by a thread, I 
      concluded that, one, it was a terrible thing to waste a life, and, two, I 
      would never be a hunter. The killing of birds or any other kind of animal 
      was not my idea of a sport. I had never fired a gun of any kind before 
      that time; being so accurate with my aim was a great surprise. It was also 
      a surprise to learn that the M-1 had such a hard kick, and I would later 
      learn in target practice to put the butt end tight into my shoulder before 
      firing. I used up the rest of the ammunition by shooting at an old log. My 
      right shoulder was quite sore when I was done. To make sure I would not be 
      caught with a rifle that smelled of gunpowder, I had brought cleaning 
      equipment with me in my gun belt. I pulled a small oil-soaked piece of 
      cloth through the barrel with a piece of string several times.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Another duty that was held like a club over our heads 
      when we goofed off was latrine duty. Cleaning up toilets and washbasins 
      used by hundreds of men daily was a dreaded assignment. I never got the 
      duty myself because soon after we started our training, it was given to a 
      couple troublemakers who had it on a near-regular basis. Like all things 
      in the Army, even this job had a title. It was called Latrine Orderly, but 
      regardless of its neutral sounding name, it was the lowest of the many 
      miserable jobs available.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      about a month in camp, we were given written exams equivalent to an IQ 
      test called the Army General Classification Test (AGCT)4. It consisted of 
      one hundred and fifty multiple-choice questions that had to be answered 
      within forty minutes. I did quite well on it and was told that I was 
      eligible for the Army's special programs including Officers Candidate 
      School (OCS). Sure I was! And I was eligible to be the Commander in Chief, 
      too. What the Army needed at this stage of the war was grunts, not more 
      leaders or students.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Several months later, I was told that because of my 
      AGCT score, I would participate with four other men from our outfit in 
      something called the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), where 
      candidates were sent to selected universities for schooling. It sounded 
      great, but nothing ever came of it, which turned out to be lucky for me. 
      When the government eliminated the program, the majority of students who 
      were part of it, as I would have been, were sent as replacements for line 
      outfits, primarily as riflemen in the infantrymen.<sup 
      >5</sup></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      learned very early in our training any special talent should not be 
      flaunted in the Army because it would usually lead to the assignment of an 
      unwanted duty. The cadre member had a sneaky way of asking an innocent 
      sounding question that would lead to a lousy detail. He would ask, "Does 
      anyone know anything about plumbing?" or, "Have any of you been in the 
      construction business?" The former led to the cleaning of the latrine, and 
      the latter to digging ditches. We all kept any specialized talent we had 
      to ourselves, and we learned not to respond to requests for help, no 
      matter how innocuous the request. One of the axioms of Army life was, 
      don't volunteer for anything.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On 
      the first of each month, we got paid. The procedure was known as, The 
      eagle flies, although sometimes it was given a more coarse interpretation. 
      For our battery, two officers sat at a card table set up just outside the 
      supply room while the enlisted men stood in line awaiting their turn. As a 
      private, I got $50.00 a month paid in cash. About half-a-dozen crap games 
      would break out immediately following. The higher-ranking noncoms were 
      reminded about the unwritten Army rule they should play only with those of 
      equal rank. This rule was designed to keep the odds more even by not 
      giving the higher paid noncoms an advantage over those who got less. 
      However, this rule came into effect only after a lot of privates had lost 
      several months pay.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      difficult training was hard on younger men who did not seem to be cut out 
      for hard work. One who fit this bill was Mel Spearing, who was a member of 
      our gun section. He was short in stature and slight of build. He reminded 
      us of our kid brothers, and most of us thought he would never make it. He 
      had a baby-face that made him look much younger than his real age, which 
      was<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Mel Spearing" vspace="8" src="images/Mel_Spearing_3_27.jpg" width="300" align="right" height="366" > 
      eighteen years old, the same as mine (See Fig. 27). He took a lot of 
      kidding about his looks and more remarks were directed at him by the 
      sergeants about his ability to do certain tasks.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">But 
      Spearing fooled them all. He put on some weight and through sheer 
      determination developed into a very fine soldier. He tried harder than 
      anyone else, and at the end of our training, nobody was laughing about the 
      little baby-faced guy. He was also a great asset to our crew throughout 
      our time together because, in addition to being fit for the job, he was 
      smart and cheerful. There were some men in the service that had great 
      physical presence but would never be the soldier that Spearing 
      was.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Most 
      of the men in our battalion were in their late teens, but about five 
      percent were in their late thirties. About twenty percent fell between 
      that age range. The Army was drafting men up to thirty-eight years old at 
      the time we were called up, including married ones if they had no 
      children. A few years difference in age means a lot more to a teen than it 
      does an older man. Men in their late twenties were looked on as seniors, 
      and those in their late thirties were considered elderly. Most men in the 
      latter group had a difficult time keeping up on the long hikes and with 
      other difficult parts of the training. However, it was the emotional 
      sacrifices that caused them the most anguish. Many of them were married, 
      and it was extremely difficult to be separated from their wives. Also, 
      many had given up careers to enter service, and they wondered about their 
      ability to pick up where they left off after the war was over.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Because the members of our gun section were together 
      almost every minute, day and night, the stiffness one feels among 
      strangers or new acquaintances soon melted away. We shared our experiences 
      and challenges we faced in life. I learned about their aspirations, which 
      were different from mine, but many similarities allowed close 
      relationships to be built. As we bonded, many of the differences between 
      us became less obvious. The mindless antics of some of our leaders and the 
      medley of unusual characters in our battery gave us plenty of ammunition 
      for interesting conversations.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">These 
      were city boys and small-town boys, with different upbringings, thrown 
      together for a common cause. Farmers were exempt from the draft, so those 
      we had volunteered for service. There were tall ones, short ones, smart 
      ones, not so smart ones, and our ages ranged over a twenty-year span. It 
      was amazing how we all jelled into a working unit. We began to know each 
      other well enough we could banter, kid, and playfully downgrade each 
      other. Almost exclusively, we called each other by our surnames. In such 
      an enclosed environment, we soon learned each other's idiosyncrasies and 
      peculiarities, and we played on them. We made fun of Bapst's first name 
      (Lovern), Le Claire's funny sounding home town (Manitowoc, Wisconsin), 
      Thomas's short stature, my tall stature (names like Stretch and Daddy Long 
      Legs were used frequently), Spearing's baby face, Dillon's dislike of 
      taking showers, Crow's deep southern accent, Hughes' antics after spending 
      the evening drinking 3-2 beer all evening at the PX, and Stevens' 
      ineptness. Anybody from the south was called a rebel, from the north you 
      were a Yankee, from Kentucky you were a ridge runner, a farmer was a hick 
      or hay-shaker, and those of us from Chicago gangsters. It was almost 
      always done in a facetious manner, but occasionally someone would carry it 
      to extremes and feelings would get hurt. However, fights were almost 
      nonexistent in our entire battery in those early days of our 
      training.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      knew the names of men's girlfriends, and even what kind of relationship 
      they had. Some of the married men brought their wives out to live in the 
      area while we were stationed in Camp Haan, and we got to meet them too. 
      Because of their limited finances, they were usually staying as boarders 
      in private homes in the nearby town of Riverside. Some married men with 
      children were drafted in late 1943, but there were none in our gun 
      section.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">One 
      of the crew, Jim Grimes (See Fig. 28), got a Dear John letter from his 
      sweetheart telling him that she was going to marry someone else. He was 
      quite upset about it. When he began to<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Jim Grimes" vspace="8" src="images/Jim_Grimes_3_28.jpg" width="250" align="left" height="308" > accept the fact that he was 
      better off without her, he was more concerned about how to have the tattoo 
      on his arm removed-a heart with the name Margie inside it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Two 
      subjects that were not discussed-kidding or otherwise-were religion and 
      nationalities. The comradeship our gun section extended, to some degree, 
      to the other men of our battery. Those in the other batteries, with a few 
      exceptions, were like strangers to us and, for many of them, we did not 
      even know their names.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      Army's jargon started to infiltrate our everyday conversations. Some terms 
      were: sack time, dog-robber, SOP (standard operating procedure), over the 
      hill (AWOL), chow, tell it to the chaplain, bucking for sergeant, rockers, 
      latrine, mess, deadbeat, deuce-and-a-half, shave tail, and PX. We soon 
      developed a speech pattern laced with swearing, although the frequency 
      varied greatly with individuals. There was also some crass talk with the 
      use of words and expressions like brown-nose, fart-sack, goose him up, 
      SNAFU, chicken s---, short-arm inspection, and clap. We no longer were 
      complaining about something, now it was bitching. Despite our loathing of 
      Montelone and the cadre members, we were picking up some of their vocal 
      expressions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      our conversations in general covered many subjects, we seldom talked about 
      current events. There were no radios in camp accessible to us, and we 
      seldom saw a newspaper not a week or more old. It seemed men who got 
      newspapers from home always lived in small towns where all the news was 
      local. With so little news getting to us, we were some of the least 
      informed-in addition to being the last to be informed-people in the 
      country about how the war was progressing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      weather in the Riverside area of southern California was beautiful. It 
      rained very little, and for most of the days, the temperature was in the 
      seventies or eighties. Every day seemed to be sunny. At night the 
      temperature went down in the fifties and low sixties, and that, along with 
      the fatigue we experienced from the great amount of physical activity we 
      did during the day, allowed for great sleeping. We slept in our underwear. 
      We went to bed lying on our blankets and awoke in the morning under 
      them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b 
      >Description of Our Outfit</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      815th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion was made up of approximately seven 
      hundred fifty men. We always traveled as a battalion whenever we moved 
      from one camp to another, out on a bivouac, on our trip overseas, and from 
      one location to another. The Battalion was broken down into five 
      batteries, called A (Able), B (Baker), C (Charlie), D (Dog), and 
      Headquarters. The four lettered batteries were further broken down into 
      two platoons each with four gun sections in each platoon so a battery had 
      eight gun sections. I was in D-Battery, gun section number one; so when I 
      referred to my outfit verbally, I said <b>"815th 
      Triple A Battalion, Dog Battery, first platoon, first gun 
      section."</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Headquarters Battery consisted of men involved with 
      supply, training, logistics, and paper shuffling. Each battery had its own 
      kitchen and staff. In addition to the main Battalion Headquarters and 
      supply system, each letter battery had its own facilities in these 
      areas.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      our battalion moved in a convoy from one place to another, it consisted of 
      thirty-two trucks pulling 40mm guns, thirty-two trucks pulling M-51 
      machine gun mounts (They came later in our training.), twenty trucks for 
      headquarters, and ten Jeeps for the officers and high-ranking noncoms, for 
      a total of ninety-four vehicles. We stretched out for several 
      miles.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Our 
      40mm antiaircraft gun was mounted on a platform that sat on a steel frame. 
      It had a ten-foot-long drawbar that was six inches in diameter with an 
      eyelet at the end for attaching to the back of a truck when moving from 
      one place to another. There was also an electrical cord that hooked up to 
      the truck that furnished power to the gun's taillights. The gun would be 
      covered by a form-fitting tarpaulin that snapped into place while 
      traveling or when not in use for a long period of time.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      we arrived at our destination, we would unhook the gun from the truck, 
      move it into position, remove the tarp, pull the outriggers out to the 
      sides, remove some safety pins, lower the gun onto four pads ninety 
      degrees apart, and then level the gun with hand cranks that were mounted 
      at the ends of the outriggers.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      gun was normally aimed by sighting through cross hairs mounted on each 
      side. There were seats for the trackers behind the cross hairs.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      was a director that could also be used to aim the 40mm gun in place of 
      using hand cranks. It was a steel box full of gears, approximately four 
      cubic feet. It sat on a tripod, which also had a leveling mechanism. There 
      was a scope on each side, and the trackers stood on the ground looking 
      through the scopes instead of sitting on the gun seats. The director was 
      usually located about fifteen feet from the gun. It had to be coordinated 
      with the gun by sighting both of them on some distant object and then 
      locking them together. The trackers had six-inch diameter wheels located 
      next to the scopes that were rotated to keep their cross hairs on a moving 
      target. The gears in the box were supposed to build in a lead on a target 
      so if you were tracking a plane, the projectile would be fired out early 
      enough to allow lead-time to reach the plane.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      we were using the director, the gun and director were powered by 
      electricity. A gasoline-driven power plant generated the electricity. The 
      gun, director, and power plant were all interconnected with heavy 
      rubber-coated electrical cable.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Another pieces of equipment in our gun section was a 
      single .50 caliber machine gun that sat on a tripod. Not too long after we 
      started training, we were issued something called the M-51 mount. It had 
      four .50 caliber machine guns in one unit, and would eventually replace 
      the single gun. The mount consisted of a turret, like those on the top of 
      a heavy bomber. The gunner sat in the middle between two large steel 
      plates with two .50 caliber machine guns mounted on each plate. Each gun 
      fired 750 rounds per minute, so theoretically, the mount could fire 3,000 
      rounds per minute. This rate of fire was difficult to sustain because it 
      was too hard to feed that much ammunition over any long period of time. 
      The turret operated on electric power furnished by batteries.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      gunner controlled both the horizontal and vertical movement with a 
      joystick that had a trigger attached. He sighted a target through 
      crosshairs. The turret was mounted on a chase that was eight-feet 
      square.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      introduction of this weapon created a lot of excitement in our battalion 
      because it greatly increased our firepower. It was a very powerful weapon. 
      Unlike the 40mm gun, the M-51 mount could be fired in the traveling 
      position. We kept both the single .50 caliber gun and the mount until 
      after our target practice was complete. We then turned in the single gun 
      to ordinance.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Each 
      gun crew and the equipment that went with them was moved via two 
      two-and-a-half ton trucks. An Army truck was usually referred to as a 
      deuce and a half. (See Fig. 29) One truck pulled the 40 mm gun while the 
      other pulled the M-51 mount. They carried the fifteen-man gun crew and our 
      ammunition, tents, cots, duffel bags, sand bags to build gun pits, power 
      plant, director, rifles, gas masks, basic cooking gear, and everything 
      else we owned in the world. Each truck had wooden ribs arched across the 
      top of the body with canvas tarpaulin over that. The back of the truck was 
      open and had a two-foot high tailgate secured with a chain at each end 
      that could be lowered to aid in unloading. The tailgate also had a stirrup 
      step at both ends for men to board and dismount.</font></p>

      >When stripes were handed out after several months of 
      training, Bud Dillon was made our gun section leader (See Fig. 30). He had 
      the rank of sergeant, or, as it is sometimes called, buck<img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Bud Dillon" vspace="10" src="images/Bud_Dillon_3_30.jpg" width="300" align="left" height="395" > sergeant (three stripes up and 
      none down). He was about three or four years older than me and the other 
      younger men in our section. He had been in the ROTC (Reserve Officer 
      Training Corps) while in high school. This training helped him and some 
      others in getting the first of the sergeant stripes passed out.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      I was in high school, my friends and I had made fun of those who were in 
      the ROTC program. Usually, but not always, they were the students who were 
      the least athletic and were taking military training to get out of 
      participating in the mandatory gym classes. But they had learned how to 
      drill troops, and this had been the ticket for many of them to earn 
      stripes in the army.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      wasn't hard to learn to respond to military commands while we were in 
      formation, but it did take a lot of practice to learn how and when to give 
      the orders with the proper cadence and timing that made others respond to 
      them. In our outfit, during our basic training, the officers used this 
      ability to drill troops as their primary criteria for selecting men to 
      make new sergeants. By the time the rest of us caught up to where we knew 
      about the same as the ex-ROTC fellows, most of the sergeant stripes had 
      already been passed out.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I was 
      made corporal and given the title of gunner, which meant I was in charge 
      of the 40mm gun crew. My salary rose to $66 a month. The two stripes also 
      meant that I was excused from KP duty. The rest of our gun crew was ranked 
      as follows: Jim Crow was a corporal in charge of the machine gun crew. 
      There were two T-5's, which is a corporal with a T (designating 
      technician) under the two stripes. They were the two truck drivers, Jim 
      Grimes and Williams. Williams also operated the power plant. The other men 
      in the crew were privates and privates first class. The fifteen-man crew 
      was divided into nine men for the 40mm and six for the M-51 mount, 
      although there was some overlapping of duties. My best friends were Joe 
      Bernal, Jim Grimes, and Glenn Le Claire (See Fig. 31), who were all of the 
      same age as I.<img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Glen LeClaire" vspace="10" src="images/Glenn_LeClaire_3_31.jpg" width="300" align="left" height="370" ></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Soon 
      after the stripes were passed out, we learned a good lesson about 
      respecting rank. Even though Dillon was now a sergeant, he still lived in 
      our hut. After months of being equal rank, we thought of him as a friend. 
      Sometimes he got to show off his ROTC training by drilling our platoon 
      when we were marching around the camp. But, in the beginning, he did not 
      have much reason to use his rank, and for that reason, we still thought of 
      him as one of us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      found out different. Dillon did not like to shower or to wash his 
      clothing. His coal black, oily hair was worn slicked back in a pompadour 
      style that made him look like somebody out of a Brylcream hair gel ad. We 
      kidded him at first, then threw obvious hints about his poor hygiene, but 
      it did not get through to him. We debated catching him at the latrine some 
      evening and giving him a GI shower, a process where men would scrub down 
      someone who refused to bathe with stiff-bristled brushes, but nobody had 
      the stomach for it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Despite the fact that the hut we were living in was 
      as open as a screened-in porch, the foul odors from Dillon and his gear 
      were starting to smell up the hut so bad, we could not live with it. 
      Finally, we took action. One evening while he was at the PX, the rest of 
      us put his duffel bag and bedding in the street in front of the hut. 
      Without giving much thought to the ramifications, we were trying to give 
      Dillon a message.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Somehow, the word got to the orderly room. All hell 
      broke loose when cadre members, Monteleone and Lieutenant Engler heard 
      about it. They interviewed us individually about why we did it; then we 
      sat and waited for the consequences. Thomas (See Fig.32) was identified as 
      the ringleader but, in fact, we were all equally guilty. We, the culprits, 
      were sure that we were going to<img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Jack Thomas" vspace="10" src="images/Jack_Thomas_3_32.jpg" width="300" align="left" height="367" > be court-martialed. But it 
      didn't happen and we wondered what was going on. When Dillon got back from 
      the PX he put his things back inside, sprinkled his equipment with 
      lavender talcum powder, then went for his interview. When he returned 
      things were quite tense between us. However, he began to wash his clothing 
      and take showers on a regular basis soon after that. He always made a big 
      thing about letting us know he was just returning from the shower room. He 
      seemed embarrassed about the whole thing and soon got over being 
      mad.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      never learned what all transpired that evening but to our amazement, no 
      action was taken against us. In fact, nobody in authority ever mentioned 
      the matter again. We were happy about that, but we also learned our 
      lesson. Don't fool around with sergeants, even when they're 
      friends.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Life 
      at Camp Haan continued to be an endless pattern of close order drilling, 
      watching training films, aircraft identification classes, guard duty, 
      working on our heavy equipment, inspections, calisthenics, hikes, 
      listening to the bawdy sergeants, and trying to forget Captain McKee's 
      stories.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As 
      the months passed, we grew more comfortable with our surroundings. We 
      experienced a mix of emotions. There were times we griped about conditions 
      and the ever-present burden of authority that kept us always on edge. We 
      would become despondent, and the mood in our hut was not happy. Other 
      times, everything seemed to go right, and something or someone would make 
      us laugh. Stories were told, comments would follow, then one crewmember 
      would try and top the other. There were good and bad days, but most were 
      somewhere in the middle. Rumors, or latrine rumors as we called them, were 
      dispensed on a steady basis. We tried hard to avoid any work relating to 
      special duties, sometimes just by being good soldiers. Some days the work, 
      like a twenty-five mile hike, would wear us out physically as well as 
      mentally. At the end of the day all we wanted to do was lie on our bunk 
      and talk to our friends. Other days when duties consisted mainly of 
      listening to instructions, those evenings were spent at the PX, at a 
      movie, or just visiting around camp.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Were 
      we really beginning to adapt to army life? The idea had seemed so 
      implausible only a few months earlier.</font></p>
