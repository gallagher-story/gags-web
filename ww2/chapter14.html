    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our Battalion convoyed approximately forty
    miles east of Le Havre to a camp located in the Forest de la Fontaine at St.
    Pierre de Varengeville. It is just six miles west of the city of Rouen.
    Along the way, we saw many small farms, which were surrounded by hedgerows
    instead of fences like it is in the States. These hedgerows were great
    obstacles to the American invasion forces during the battle here in
    Normandy, some months before and were responsible for heavy casualties to
    the American forces. They were easy to defend by the German army and
    difficult to surmount by the American troops. Destroyed tanks and other
    military vehicles dotted the landscape as reminders of the fierce battles.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The name of the camp where we stayed was
    Twenty Grand, and it consisted of thousands of six-man pyramidal tents set
    up as a staging area where newly arrived GIs would be assigned their duties
    in the ETO (See Fig. 71). There were nine separate camps that were used for
    this purpose, located in an area between the cities of LeHavre and Rouen.
    They were all named after the popular American cigarettes of the day (See
    Fig. 72). In addition to Camp Twenty Grand, there were Camps Lucky Strikes,
    Philip Morris, Herbert Tareyton, Pall Mall, Wings, Old Gold, Home Run, and
    Chesterfield.</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Twenty Grand Cigarettes" vspace="8" src="images/Twenty_Grand_cigarettes_14_72.jpg" width="237" align="right" height="412"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">These camps were also known as replacement
    depots or, by the abbreviated version used by most GIs, "repo depos."
    The naming of the cigarette camps resulted from an attempt by the Allies to
    keep them secret from the Germans. The Allies felt that any interception of
    messages relating to them would be interpreted as referring to cigarettes,
    not camps. They were never referred to by their geographical location.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We parked our trucks in an area of our camp
    called a "motor pool" and carried our personal gear over to
    prescribed tents. It's hard to describe how large these camps were. The many
    rows of tents in long parallel lines seemed to fade into the nearby forest.
    If there were any permanent structures in the camp, we did not see them. It
    was nothing but canvas as far as we could see. The tents were black and were
    furnished with the standard canvas army cots and a pot-bellied stove in the
    center. Even though it did not rain while we were there, evidently it had
    done so just before. The dirt floors of the tents and most of the outside
    area were a sea of mud. To keep our equipment dry, we had to pile it on our
    bunks. This left little room for us to lie down and sleep, but we had
    learned to improvise during our trip across the Atlantic Ocean and again in
    Camp Stapley in England.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we were crossing the English Channel and
    while on the convoy to Camp Twenty Grand, we had been eating C-rations, but
    in camp, we got fresh food - well, it was almost fresh. The milk, eggs, and
    mashed potatoes were all made from dehydrated materials, and most of the
    meat, vegetables, and fruit came out of cans. Nevertheless, it still beat
    rations. The chow lines were over a block long, and we were served food in
    our mess kits. We would extend the kit toward the cooks who were ladling the
    food out of large aluminum pots. It was all done with quick jabbing
    movements as we moved down the line trying to keep up with their sequence of
    serving. Little effort was made by them to aim at a specific spot of the
    mess kit so it was up to us to maneuver it as we saw the food coming. These
    cooks had been serving many thousands of men, three meals a day, for many
    months, and they had lost all semblance of social grace or even common
    courtesy. They were obviously overworked and were taking out their
    frustration on everyone in sight. They had heard every derogatory comment
    and smart remark about the quality of the food that could be generated by
    GIs who were looking for any opportunity to criticize. They were ready and
    on the defense for anything that was said. I remember hearing one soldier
    complaining to a cook as he was being served, "It looks like
    garbage," and the reply came back in an instant, "Well, it should,
    we just took it out of the garbage can over there and just added a little
    pepper, or was that mouse droppings?" Another GI asked in a sarcastic
    voice, "Is that all you can afford?" about his meager portion of
    dessert. The answer was, "I give out portions here based on the size of
    your brain, but I gave you a little more than you deserved because I'm such
    a nice guy." Between their retorts, the cooks kept up a steady cadence
    of "Move it on, move it on." We walked back to the tents where we
    were billeted with our food, a trip that guaranteed that its lukewarm
    condition would become even colder. There, we sat on the edge of our bunks
    to eat while balancing the mess kit on our laps. After a meal, we returned
    to the mess tent where we waited in another long line to clean our kits in
    four 55-gallon garbage cans lined up in a row. The first can was for
    garbage, the second had boiling soapy water with several GI brushes hanging
    off of it for scrubbing, and the next two were also boiling but clear water
    for rinsing, almost clear. All cans had a good amount of solids floating on
    top.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the oldest and most consistent army
    rumors started to crop up again in this cigarette camp. It was the
    contention that the cooks put saltpeter in our food to reduce our sexual
    drive. No one ever saw it done or had any proof, but some men would swear
    that "someone who really knows" had told them it was so. There
    usually followed the inevitable conclusion, based on the jealousy that we
    felt for the preferential treatment given officers, that it was not added to
    the officers' mess. After being discussed in my tent for several minutes, we
    all decided that if they did add saltpeter to our food, it wasn't going to
    make any difference where we were going.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At Camp Twenty Grand, we were assigned to the
    Third Army under the command of General George Patton. We learned at this
    camp that the First, Third, and Seventh Armies were all part of what was
    known as the Twelfth Army Group with General Omar Bradley in charge. General
    Eisenhower, the Allied Supreme Commander in Europe (See Fig. 73) in addition
    to commanding the Twelfth group, also commanded the Twenty-First Group under
    British General Montgomery and the American Sixth Group under Lieutenant
    General Jacob Deaver.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="General Eisenhower, General Bradley, General Patten" src ="images/Three_Generals_14_73.jpg" width=600 height=567 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Patton had already established quite a
    reputation for himself as a great battlefield commander. Also, he was
    considered to be profane, unpredictable, and hotheaded by none other than
    General Bradley, his immediate superior. To the average GI, Patton was known
    as "Old Blood and Guts" because of a speech he made to some of his
    troops in which he said, "with your blood and my guts." He was
    known for his insistence on "spit and polish" for his troops, even
    down to what could be enforced in a combat area. Wearing a complete uniform
    and a steel helmet at all times were two of his favorite rules. Rifles and
    equipment were to be kept clean and in good working condition at all times.
    There was a rumor that he insisted on us wearing ties, but it proved to be
    false. We knew that some of the regulations that were passed on to us at
    this camp by our officers were not requirements of Patton. It was just a
    convenient way to threaten us into obeying a bunch of strict rules. We felt
    that they had probably thought them up on the spot. Because of Patton's
    reputation as a tyrant, it was convenient to instill fear of reprisal on
    members of his army by using his name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had heard some, but not a lot, about his
    battlefield successes in North Africa, Sicily, the Battle of the Bulge, and,
    at this point, his drive across Northern France and now we were told that we
    were going to join his army's drive into Germany. While we were impressed
    with his battle victories, we were thinking more about his reputation for
    strict discipline and his violent temper. He had slapped a couple of
    soldiers who were suffering from battle fatigue when he visited hospitals in
    Italy, and the incidents had caused him to temporarily lose his command.
    Despite our being leery about our new commander, when we were all given
    shoulder patches for the Third Army, we were proud to sew them on the left
    sleeve of our uniforms and did it immediately.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We packed up the trucks on March 10th (See
    Fig. 74) and traveled east again for 135 miles to another camp near Reims,
    France. Along the way, we saw many more bombed and shelled towns, and only
    occasionally there would be one that had been spared major damage. Abandoned
    or destroyed military equipment, both American and German, was scattered
    along the sides of the roadways, in open fields and throughout the towns we
    passed through.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Camp Twenty Grand - Loading Truck" src ="images/Loading_Up_Camp_Twenty_Grand_14_74.jpg" width=600 height=403 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This new camp was almost identical to Camp
    Twenty Grand, but, in addition, it had a major supply depot. There were
    stockpiles of everything you could think of from tanks to toilet paper (See
    Fig.75). Across from our tent were two-and-a-half ton trucks lined up in
    rows, more than I had ever seen before. Allied planes were always flying
    cover overhead. Many years later, I learned that Reims was the headquarters
    for General Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was in Europe.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="40mm guns lined up in ordinance" src ="images/40mm_guns_lined_up_14_75.jpg" width=600 height=339 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There had been an advance party from Battery
    A of our Battalion who were there to meet us at Reims. They had landed at
    Rouen instead of Le Havre in their LSTs and proceeded directly to Reims to
    prepare for our arrival. They had our tents assigned, a mess kitchen set up,
    and lists of munitions we were to pick up there.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The morning of our arrival at that camp, our
    Battalion had its second casualty. The men from Battery A were staying in
    the tents, but they were using a nearby building for storing supplies. The
    night before we arrived, someone stored a dozen or so five-gallon gasoline
    cans, known as "jerry cans," in an enclosed room with the tops
    left open. The next morning, a soldier from Battery A went into the room
    that was now filled with gasoline vapor. He lit a match and blew the end off
    of the building. The soldier was badly wounded and they described him as
    being "packed in grease" when he was shipped out just before we
    arrived.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first day there, we drew ammunition for
    our rifles, the 40 mm guns, hand grenades, TNT, and some miscellaneous
    items. Then the brass did something really dumb. They issued us new M-1
    rifles. Because the sights on each rifle is a little bit different and often
    shoots a little off center, we had no way of knowing what characteristics
    the new ones had without shooting on a firing range. The guns we had turned
    in were the ones that we had qualified with on the Mojave Desert. We did not
    get a chance to fire the new rifles until we did some target practicing at
    our first gun emplacement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Most of the towns we passed through were
    badly torn up from the battles that had been fought there but occasionally
    there was one with less damage. Less usual meant most windows were blown out
    but the badly pocked buildings were still structurally sound (See Figs. 76a
    and 76b).<br>
