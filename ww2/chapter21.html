    After a long trip by convoy, we entered another heavily bombed city on April 
    24th.&nbsp; The depressing look of the landscape, being jostled around on the 
    truck during the long ride from our last destination, a lack of meaningful 
    sleep, and the miserable rations all contributed to a wretched state of 
    mind.&nbsp; Everyone was in a bad mood, and the unpleasant situation we were 
    about to experience would be the fuse that would light a near riot among our 
    crewmembers.&nbsp; We pulled down a ramp from the street to the bank of the Main 
    River in the city of Wurzburg.&nbsp;Wurzburg was a city of considerable
    historical value but of little military importance. Most of the cities of
    military significance had already been reduced to rubble by the Allied
    Airforce. Wurzburg was bombed, as described by a German citizen,
    "Because it was there and it was better than bombing
    nothing".&nbsp; Like in Frankfurt, this site was right in 
    the middle of a large urban area.&nbsp; Before it got dark, we pitched our two 
    pyramid tents near the ramp.&nbsp; We knew there was no chance of finding a 
    permanent structure nearby to use for our billet because the buildings in 
    our area were so heavily damaged.&nbsp; In fact, those near our position were 
    nothing more than piles of rubble. The Germans called Wurzburg, "The
    grave on the river Main".<br>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Digging in that night was extremely difficult because the ground was hard clay 
  that could not be shoveled out.&nbsp; We had to use long-handled axes to loosen it 
  and then move on to the shovels.&nbsp; We worked all night, and by dawn we were 
  completely worn out.&nbsp; The 40mm gun was still up on the ground because we had 
  decided the gun pit still needed some work, maybe a lot of work.&nbsp; It was 
  poorly shaped, it wasn’t deep enough, and its footprint was too small.&nbsp; We 
  were debating what to do to get by with the least amount of additional work.&nbsp; 
  Ordinarily, we could have built up the shallow pit with more than the usual 
  number of sandbags, but here we had fewer sandbags.&nbsp; The chunks of earth we 
  had dug out did not nest well in the bags. We were all discouraged, tired, and 
  more than a little ornery.&nbsp; Dillon was trying to push us to complete the work, 
  but even he did not have his heart in it.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  There was another factor weighing on us and that was the thought of digging 
  the director pit. The director was a separate instrument that could be used to 
  track planes and it replaced the hand cranks on the gun proper.&nbsp; We hated the 
  director because it was not as accurate as the gun sights, especially after 
  being bounced around on the back of a truck for a long period of time; it took 
  too long to pick up a target, making it useless with low-flying aircraft that 
  were visible only for a few seconds; it was a lot of work unloading and 
  loading from the truck; and of immediate concern, it required a special pit of 
  its own, which meant more digging.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  officers in our battery were always after us to use the director.&nbsp; The 
  question was, use it on what?&nbsp; We had not seen an enemy plane in weeks and 
  were beginning to wonder if the Luftwaffe was a thing of the past.&nbsp; We set it 
  up at all our previous gun pits, but we never used it.&nbsp; We thought this would 
  be a good time to leave it on the truck where it belonged.&nbsp; But we knew the 
  first thing the brass would notice if they came around for an inspection was 
  the missing director, so we decided we had better put it in place again, even 
  though we had no intentions of using it.&nbsp; This meant digging another pit about 
  eight feet in diameter and about four feet deep next to the gun pit.&nbsp; We 
  debated whether we should complete the gun pit first or start on the director 
  pit in order to complete them at the same time.</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><b>TNT
    In The Wrong Hands Is Dangerous</b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="3">As 
  we were mulling over the situation, Boom-Boom Williams (See
  Fig. 126a) suggested we let him 
  blast the director pit with TNT.&nbsp; He was the battery expert on explosives, and 
  thus we had tagged him with the name Boom-Boom.&nbsp; It was a name he did not like 
  so we only used it when he was not around.&nbsp; He was the least liked of all the 
  crewmembers because he was a very brooding kind of person and seldom entered 
  any of our conversations.&nbsp; He also liked to goof-off whenever there was work<img border="0" alt="Boom Boom Williams" src ="images/Boom_Boom_Williams_21_126a.jpg" width=425 align=right height=655 > 
  to be done.&nbsp; His official title was Power Plant Operator, and he took that to 
  mean it was his only responsibility.&nbsp; He was always puttering around with the 
  power plant to avoid other assignments, even though we had never used it 
  because it was only required to operate the director.&nbsp; In addition to being 
  unpopular, the rest of the crew thought he was a bit peculiar.&nbsp; He pulled a 
  really dumb stunt when we were training back in the States.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">He 
  was lecturing the whole battery on how to handle explosives while we were at 
  Camp Irwin in the Mojave Desert.&nbsp; We were all sitting around on the sand while 
  he and one of the officers were standing next to the latrine building.&nbsp; He 
  suddenly took a stick of dynamite, broke it over his knee, and slapped it 
  against the wooden building behind him as hard as he could.&nbsp; We thought the 
  officer standing next to him was going to faint, and a lot of the rest of us 
  sat up straight.&nbsp; Boom-Boom was trying to demonstrate explosives are dangerous 
  only when they have an ignition cap in them.&nbsp; I had seen Boom-Boom studying 
  Army manuals about explosives, and I, along with others in our gun section, 
  felt he was no expert at all.&nbsp; He was very vague about his experiences in 
  civilian life.&nbsp; We believed he had just read a few more manuals than the rest 
  of us.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In 
  our position at Wurzburg, however, we were desperate for a solution to our 
  problem, so we agreed to let Boom-Boom blast the director pit before we put 
  the 40mm into its new pit.&nbsp; Although we did not have a lot of confidence in 
  him, most of the rest of us did not like to set off explosives and were happy 
  to defer to him.&nbsp; With great effort, we dug a posthole about four feet deep at 
  the director’s site.&nbsp; The hole was centered about ten feet from the edge of 
  the gun pit.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  TNT was carried in the back of our truck and was not given any special 
  handling.&nbsp; The other ammunition was in wooden boxes that were sometimes 
  handled quite roughly, and we were not any more concerned with the TNT cases.&nbsp; 
  On the other hand, the blasting caps for the TNT were handled with great 
  care.&nbsp; They were stored in the glove compartment of the truck’s cab where they 
  were protected from shifting during travel.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Boom-Boom got the caps and inserted them into the quarter-pound packets of 
  TNT.&nbsp; Then he started to pack them down into the posthole.&nbsp; We all thought he 
  was using too many explosives, but then we thought, he’s the expert.&nbsp; We stood 
  back when he started to ram it down with a board.&nbsp; “God damn it, Williams, ” 
  shouted Dillon, “What the hell are you trying to do, get us all killed?”&nbsp; 
  Rough handling was one thing, but hammering it down with a board, while the 
  caps were installed, was something else.&nbsp; Boom-Boom liked to see people squirm 
  when he handled the explosives roughly.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">He 
  then ran copper wires back from the TNT to the telephone and wrapped them 
  around the terminals.&nbsp; We put the 40mm gun canvas cover back on to protect it 
  from flying particles.&nbsp; We all moved back a considerable distance from the 
  site just before he turned the crank of the telephone to generate an 
  electrical charge.&nbsp; When the explosives went off (See Fig. 126), it threw dirt 
  forty feet high, and we all got showered with flying clumps of dirt, even 
  though we thought we had backed off far enough.&nbsp; It was a good thing we were 
  wearing our steel helmets.&nbsp; The dirt rained down on us with the force of 
  falling rocks.&nbsp; When we went up to the new pit, we saw he had blown most of 
  the dirt from the new director pit into the 40mm gun pit that we had just dug 
  out.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">"<font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">You 
  dumb son-of-a-bitch, Williams!” yelled Wellington.&nbsp; “Look at what you’ve 
  done.”</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  “He’s too dumb to be a dumb son-of-a-bitch,” said Grimes.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">“Get 
  your ass out of here you incompetent boob,” cried Dillon, before he realized 
  that he had no place to go.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  explosion and the barrage of obscenities being hurled from every direction at 
  this early hour caused gun section number two, across the river, to yell, 
  “What the hell’s going on over there?”&nbsp; We had not strung our telephone wire 
  yet so we had no working telephone.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  “Williams just dynamited the director pit into the gun pit, and we have to 
  start digging all over again,” I shouted over to them.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  word was passed around over there, and soon we could hear them laughing their 
  sides off.&nbsp; It might have been funny to them but to our crew, it was anything 
  but amusing.&nbsp; Finally, someone from across the river shouted, “The boys here 
  send their condolences: tough s---.” Followed by another round of laughter.&nbsp; 
  Now we were mad at all of the men in gun section number two, in addition to 
  Williams.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Boom-Boom came real close to getting shot that mornings as numerous threats 
  were made to him and his nickname was changed from Boom-Boom to something much 
  more crass.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Finally, we all grabbed our shovels, moved into the nearly full gun pit and 
  went to work trying to correct the situation.&nbsp; It was our first failure at 
  building one of those structures, and everyone was anxious to do it right.&nbsp; 
  The sun was coming up.&nbsp; If the TNT had not done anything else, it had at least 
  pumped our adrenaline, and nobody talked about being tired.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  Williams was up on the back of his truck rolling a homemade cigarette.&nbsp; He had 
  his sack of Bull Durham tobacco out and was shaping the small piece of beige 
  colored paper between his two fingers.&nbsp; Le Claire commented, “He should stay 
  out of the explosive field and concentrate on rolling cigarettes.&nbsp; That’s the 
  only thing he can do right.”&nbsp; He rolled the ends of the cigarette, stuck one 
  end in the corner of his mouth without lighting it and pretended to look busy 
  working on the power plant.&nbsp; The power plant was the heaviest piece of 
  equipment carried on the bed of the truck.&nbsp; It took a minimum of six men to 
  unload it, and usually we used eight.&nbsp; We knew Williams would be looking for 
  help unloading it later in the day, and we could not wait until he asked us 
  for assistance.&nbsp; It took us all day to get both pits operational.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 
  several days before the power plant got unloaded and longer than that before 
  anybody talked to Williams.</span></font></p>

  gun position was right next to a partially bombed-out concrete bridge that had 
  large statues of lions.&nbsp; It was known locally as the Lyons Bridge but the
  real name was Ludwig's Bridge. It is flanked by two enormous bronze lions on
  each end, the symbols of Bavaria.&nbsp; The American engineers had repaired the bridge with timber and army 
  trucks were moving across it.&nbsp; Our gun pit was about twenty feet in from the 
  edge of the river.&nbsp; Behind our gun position, away from the river was an 
  elevated road named Neubaustrasse, and behind it a heavily bombed residential neighborhood (See 
  Fig. 127).&nbsp; The ground sloped up sharply, and atop the hill was the large and 
  impressive looking medieval Marienberg Fortress - Germany's biggest and best
  preserved fortress castle (See Fig. 128).<br>

  Several days after we arrived at this location, the Battalion chaplain came 
  around and held services for us.&nbsp; “This is the second service in less than a 
  week.&nbsp; What are they trying to do; pray our way out of this war?” commented 
  Thomas.&nbsp; The chaplain stood in the gun pit, while the rest of us sat around on 
  the sandbags (See Fig. 129).&nbsp; He passed around booklets to us and then read 
  from the Bible and said several prayers.&nbsp; He was a very pleasant guy and very 
  popular with the troops, although we had not seen a lot of him while we were 
  in Europe.&nbsp; Ironically, sometime later, the <i>Stars and Stripes </i>newspaper 
  published a Willie and Joe cartoon (drawn by Bill Mauldin) where a chaplain 
  was holding services in a 40mm gun pit (See Fig. 130).<br>

  After the service time began to drag and we were looking for something to do 
  in our off hours.&nbsp; Le Claire found a German MG 42 machine gun someplace, and 
  we were dying to try it out.&nbsp; Their guns fired at 1,500 rounds per minute; 
  twice the rate of the American machine guns.&nbsp; They made one blurred sound, 
  unlike the American’s, where every individual shot is heard.&nbsp; The German gun’s 
  noise sounds like <i>brrrrp</i>, and for that reason, it is called a Burp 
  Gun.&nbsp; Because it uses so much ammunition, it could be fired only in short 
  bursts.&nbsp; We had heard a lot about this weapon and were anxious to see how it 
  worked.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Le 
  Claire, Grimes, and I set out along the river bank to find a place to fire it 
  and settled on a little clearing about two hundred feet downstream from our 
  gun emplacement.&nbsp; We set the gun on its tripod, facing across the river, 
  aiming into some woods.&nbsp; We had trouble getting it to fire on automatic, so 
  with the two of them holding the gun, I pulled the belt of ammunition through 
  the gun several times.&nbsp; It made the expected <i>brrrrp</i> sound.&nbsp; There was 
  no other shooting going on in the town, so the loud noise really stood out.&nbsp; 
  We decided the gun was broken, so we abandoned it where it had been fired 
  because we had another one in the truck.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">When 
  we got back to the gun pit, we heard by phone that the men in gun section 
  number two were having a fit.&nbsp; They insisted they were being fired upon 
  because they were located right next to the forest into which we had been 
  firing.&nbsp; They reported by phone, they were sure it was Germans because the 
  machine gun had that distinctive sound to it.&nbsp; They said they were down in 
  their gun pit taking cover.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">It 
  turned out Le Claire hated the sergeant over there for some long-past 
  incident, and because our crew had been the butt of their jokes early that 
  morning, he thought it would be fun to fire near them.&nbsp; I had noticed he 
  wanted to sweep the barrel of the gun to the left where their gun pit was 
  located instead of keeping it straight ahead toward the woods.&nbsp; He fired high 
  enough to keep from hitting anyone, but the shells tearing through the forest 
  must have been unnerving to say the least.&nbsp; When the rest of our crewmembers 
  were told about the near miss, they considered it proper retaliation for being 
  laughed at earlier that day.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Headquarters was asking all 
  kinds of questions about the shooting with the one addressed to our gun 
  section being, “How come you guys didn’t see anything?&nbsp; The noise came from 
  your side of the river.”</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Our 
  reply was, “We heard it but it sounded like it was a long way downstream.”</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Some 
  infantry GIs were billeted down the road from us, and several of them came by 
  and asked what we knew about the incident.&nbsp; We told them we had seen a couple 
  of GIs carrying a gun like that down the river.&nbsp; They headed off in that 
  direction.&nbsp; The matter soon blew over.&nbsp; We expected a visit from someone from 
  headquarters and had our story all rehearsed but nobody showed up.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
  While several of our crewmembers were out scrounging about later that day, 
  they found several German officer caps.&nbsp; They put them on back at the gun pit 
  and did their best at mimicking the Nazis salute they had seen in movies (See 
  Fig. 131).&nbsp; They also picked up a cooking stove in a bombed-out building.&nbsp; 
  While we didn’t need any additional furniture, this piece seemed to have a lot 
  of possibilities.&nbsp; It was coal burning and had a large well along one side for 
  heating water.&nbsp; They brought it back to our site and set it up. They also 
  found a lot of high-grade coal briquettes to burn in it.&nbsp; We started to make 
  hot water to heat our ration cans and to make coffee.&nbsp; Some of us had begun to 
  drink coffee; not because we enjoyed it, but because it was better than the 
  only other alternative–cold lemonade.&nbsp; Also, the coffee did a better job of 
  hiding the chlorine taste of the water.<br>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img border="0" alt="Stevens and LeClaire do Nazi salute" src ="images/Stevens_and_LeClaire_saluting_like_Nazi_21_131.jpg" width=550 height=479 ></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 
  infantry troops stationed nearby started to line up to get a cup of hot 
  water.&nbsp; It’s hard to imagine what a luxury this was unless you hadn’t had one 
  in weeks, or maybe months.&nbsp; Soon, we had a line of GIs a block long.&nbsp; We kept 
  stoking the fire and had the stove glowing red hot in order to keep up with 
  the demand.&nbsp; When we ran out of water, the infantrymen brought us some and the 
  party continued.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I 
  learned the GIs were members of the 42<sup>nd</sup> Infantry Division, better 
  known as the Rainbow Division.&nbsp; Their unit had an outstanding war record and 
  they had captured the town of Wurzburg from the Germans.&nbsp; Their commander, 
  General Harry Collins (not to be confused with the other General Harry Collins 
  who was an aide to General Eisenhower), was a shirt-tail relative of mine (a 
  relative of his married one of mine).</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
  left Wurzburg on Saturday, April 28, and headed southeast.&nbsp; We noticed we were 
  no longer headed in a northeast direction toward Berlin.&nbsp; A good part of the 
  Third and Seventh Armies were making a big turn southeast toward Bavaria, 
  Czechoslovakia and Austria.&nbsp; Many years later, I learned this was decided at a 
  meeting of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph 
  Stalin, at the Yalta Conference on February 4<sup>th </sup>in the Crimea (see 
  Fig. 132).<br>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">We 
  passed through Nuremberg, a city that had a special significance for Adolf 
  Hitler and the Nazi Party.&nbsp; It was here they staged some of their greatest 
  rallies as Hitler whipped his followers into mass hysteria with his fiery 
  oratory and grand pageantry.&nbsp; The city had been totally destroyed by Allied 
  bombing raids.&nbsp; Of all of the damaged towns, villages, and cities we had seen, 
  it would be hard to match the destruction found in Nuremberg.&nbsp; Had the Allies 
  made a special effort to destroy this seat of the Nazi Party?</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Most 
  of the heavy bombing by the Allied planes was saturated bombing which made no 
  distinction between strategic military targets and civilian dwellings.&nbsp; There 
  was a rumor later in the war the Allied high command felt there were too many 
  civilian casualties in Germany.&nbsp; Another opinion was they were getting what 
  they deserved.&nbsp; From my observation, the mass destruction of cities went way 
  beyond what was needed for military purposes (See Fig. 133).&nbsp; Anything or 
  anyone who was good (churches, schools, hospitals, innocent civilians, etc.) 
  had been destroyed along with the Nazis and strategic targets.<br>

  two nights, we bivouacked in an open area outside Nuremberg.&nbsp; At this 
  temporary camp, we heard an interesting and sad story from the men of Battery 
  A.&nbsp; They told us about being buzzed by a plane that had no propeller, 
  obviously the Germans’ new jet, a Messerschmitt ME 262.&nbsp; The plane did not 
  fire on them, and it was fast enough to get away before they could open up on 
  it.&nbsp; When they first saw it coming in low, a sergeant who was standing on a 
  moving M-51 machine gun mount ducked for cover.&nbsp; When he did, he lost his 
  balance, fell under the wheels of the mount, and was killed.&nbsp; The number of

  Somewhere south of Nuremberg, our convoy stopped in the middle of a small 
  town.&nbsp; While sitting there for about ten minutes, one of the crewmembers from 
  another gun section dismount from his truck and run into a civilian home.&nbsp; We 
  wondered what he was up to because he was known to be the number one 
  troublemaker in our outfit.&nbsp; In a few minutes he came out carrying a large and 
  opulently decorated silver tea set that he threw on his truck before climbing 
  on board himself.&nbsp; The woman of the house was standing in the doorway with a 
  frightened look on her face.&nbsp; While some of us had participated in some 
  looting ourselves, we considered this to be a step over the line.&nbsp; Taking from 
  a bombed out house was one thing but to openly rob someone was something 
  else.&nbsp; Perhaps we were drawing too fine a line between the two, but that’s the 
  way we looked at it.&nbsp; A lot of our distaste for this action had to do with the 
  fellow who did the robbing.&nbsp; He was despised for his immoral way of living 
  except by a few of his stripe.&nbsp; Back at Camp Haan, he had been accused of 
  stealing from his fellow GIs on more than one occasion.&nbsp; It would come as no 
  surprise to anyone when, after the war was over, he was shipped off to prison 
  for dealing heavily in the black market.</span></font></p>
