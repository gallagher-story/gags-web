    <p><font face="Arial">We packed up, formed a convoy of Batteries C, D, and 
    Headquarters down Heerstrasse, the main street of St. Goar, and then moved 
    out across the pontoon bridge the engineers had built. On the other side we 
    picked up Batteries A and B who had been guarding that side of the river. As
    usual, the M-51 mounts had their four .50 caliber machine guns loaded and
    ready to fire.&nbsp; A gunner sat in the bucket seat scanning the sky (See
    Fig. 112b).</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">While passing through St. Goarshausen, we saw more of the damage done by the 
    artillery barrage and the guns from the tank destroyers. There were many 
    destroyed German vehicles along the road. For all the shells that had rained 
    down on that town, it was still in fairly good conditions overall. We 
    concluded the towns with severe damage had been the recipients of heavy 
    bombing attacks, not just artillery shelling. The dead and wounded were all 
    removed, and civilians were back milling about. They did not seem to look as 
    downhearted as those we had seen in other German towns. The children would 
    watch us as we passed, while the adults ignored us.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">When we climbed up and out of the gorge, the terrain 
  became heavily wooded and very hilly. The road twisted and turned as it 
  wandered through valleys and up the sides of the mountains. We hit a stretch 
  of road where it meandered back and forth on the side of a mountain, making 
  the convoy looked like a snake uncoiling. At times, some of the convoy was 
  going in one direction and we could look across a gorge and see another part 
  going the opposite direction. On one side of the road, there was a blank face 
  that rose straight up and the other side pitched downward into deep canyons. 
  The grade was steep, and our trucks were groaning under their loads. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>More Trouble With Our Truck</b></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We cleared the mountain and were most of the way down 
  into a valley on the other side when our truck engine started to smoke 
  heavily. We pulled to the side of the road to allow the rest of the convoy 
  continue on. The engine died, and, after it cooled down, it would not turn 
  over. Lt. Engler came by in a Jeep and told us he would send us help when the 
  convoy reached Frankfurt am Main, our Battalion’s next stop. He then left to 
  rejoin the convoy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Grimes worked under the hood of the truck for some time 
  and concluded the engine was frozen, which meant it could not be fixed at this 
  location. We were about ten miles outside of St. Goarshausen. The crew members 
  of our M-51 mount machine gun, who were on the other truck, had gone ahead 
  with the rest of the convoy, leaving us eight men, the 40mm gun, and the 
  heavily laden disabled truck in the middle of a valley.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">This broken-down truck was the same one we had used to 
  make a reconnaissance down into St. Goar with Lieutenant Kraft just a few 
  weeks earlier. What if this had happened then?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We were parked at the side of the road next to a small 
  clearing. There was rich green foliage and trees everywhere except the winding 
  two-lane road. There were no personnel or houses anywhere in sight. We 
  wondered if we had gotten off the main supply route because there was 
  absolutely no traffic going past our site. For the remaining part of the day, 
  we just stood around and talked. Later, we put our bedrolls down on the tall 
  grass of the clearing that acted as cushions and laid on them in preparation 
  for sleeping that night. We kept hearing noises in the woods. We wondered if 
  it was animals or stray German soldiers because we had been told the Germans 
  left snipers behind when they retreated to slow down the advancing Americans. 
  The two dead German soldiers we had come across up on the ridge above St. Goar 
  were good examples this was not just another unfounded rumor. Could there 
  still be snipers around? We were sure no one had bothered to stop and clear 
  these woods in a mopping up operation. If there were German soldiers in those 
  woods, they would be hungry and desperate. The Third Army was hell-bent on 
  capturing town after town, and they figured any stragglers left between towns 
  would eventually surrender on their own. Also, before we left St. Goar, we had 
  heard a rumor (confirmed much later) that despite the fact the main thrust of 
  the Third Army had already advanced some distance past the Rhine River, there 
  were pockets of resistance near the Rhine and we were in one of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Time dragged while we were there with nothing to do. 
  Idleness brought on apprehension about our location. Why weren’t there any 
  Army vehicles on the road? Was there some ominous reason for this? The sky 
  became more overcast in late afternoon and the sun seemed to set earlier than 
  usual as it dropping behind the tree-covered ridge of the mountains. During 
  daylight the scenery was beautiful, but as the sun went down, the beauty went 
  with it. First, the long shadows began to hide details as dusk settled over us 
  like a blanket. Then, a blue-gray haze covered the area leaving only the 
  outline of the mountains against the darkening sky. The forest became dark 
  well before the open area did. Things began to look more than a little bit 
  eerie. We moved our rifles closer so we could get to them in a hurry. Before 
  complete darkness fell, we talked about building a fire but decided it might 
  not be the best thing to do. It would draw attention to our site if there were 
  any German stragglers still about. We put a guard out and the rest of us lay 
  in the dark talking until we dozed off to sleep. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">My guard duty shift was from 0200 to 0400 hours. It was 
  a time I won’t forget. The guard ahead of me woke me at 0200 hours sharp. He 
  had a lit flashlight in his hand, but he turned it off immediately as he 
  reached his bedroll. I knew everyone else was sound asleep. We did not like to 
  use flashlights under those circumstances because it made the holder a perfect 
  target if an enemy soldier was nearby. It was so dark out you literally could 
  not see your hand in front of your face. It was such a strange feeling having 
  your eyes wide open and not being able to see a solitary thing, especially 
  after coming out of a sound sleep. Without using my flashlight, I stumbled up 
  to where the truck was parked, felt for it, and then stood on the road with my 
  shoulder touching it for orientation. I cocked my M-1 rifle to put a round in 
  the chamber, but there was already one there, and I ejected a shell onto the 
  ground. It bounced on the pavement and seemed to roll a long distance before 
  it came to rest. I made no effort to retrieve it. The rifle in my hands, which 
  usually supplied me with a great deal of confidence, did not quiet my jitters. 
  I felt as though I was unprotected against some invisible danger, real or 
  imagined, I was confronting alone. Even though there were seven other 
  crewmembers only a few yards from me, the loneliness persisted in the 
  pitch-blackness. I had pulled guard duty a hundred times before this in my 
  Army career without feeling the same apprehension. There was something 
  different about this situation. Was it the location or the total darkness? 
  There were crewmembers snoring and noises I could not identify coming out of 
  the woods nearby, and my imagination was running rampant. Was that someone 
  coming up on us? Were we all going to be killed by some German stragglers? 
  Should I put on my flashlight? If I did, would I be the first one killed? It 
  occurred to me several times to wake some or all of the other crewmembers. But 
  what would I say to them? “I’m scared.” “I want some help.” “I hear noises.” 
  “It’s pitch black and I can’t see a thing.” None of them sounded right. A 
  couple of men had pulled the same guard duty before me, under the same 
  circumstances, and they didn’t wake anyone for help. I finally decided to just 
  wait it out and make the most of the situation. Also, I finally realized I was 
  still half asleep. I tried to do some exercises to stay alert and hopefully 
  take my mind off those noises. But, with nothing to orient on, I kept losing 
  my balance. I looked at my watch; it was ten minutes after 0200 hours. My eyes 
  began to hurt from the strain of glaring out into the darkness and seeing 
  absolutely nothing. Those two hours seemed like an eternity. Finally, at 0400 
  hours, I woke my replacement, and unlike the fellow who preceded me on guard 
  duty, I stayed with him for about half an hour before going off to bed. 
  Nothing really happened that night, but I can remember it like it was 
  yesterday.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next morning a tow truck showed up and hauled us 
  into a supply depot in the town of Rudesheim back on the Rhine River. We got a 
  new truck, transferred our equipment, hitched up the 40mm, and took off 
  heading east for Frankfurt. We hoped we would have better luck with this new 
  truck, especially with the tires.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Adventures In A Big City</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We arrived in Frankfurt on the evening of April 11. It 
  was the biggest city we had been in up until that time and bigger meant more 
  destruction. It differed from other German towns in that the destruction was 
  spread out over a bigger area. The city had tremendous damage from Allied 
  bombers. There were buildings in some parts of the city that seemed to be 
  habitable as long as living without windows, roof missing several area and 
  pock-marked walls did not bother you. In other areas, there was near or total 
  destruction. We drove around the city, looking for members of our battalion 
  but were unable to find them. It was getting dark, so we decided to bed down 
  for the night. We picked a deserted street in a business district that had 
  shops (not open) on both sides. At that time of evening, there were no 
  civilians to be seen, even though there were many apartment buildings, or 
  parts of the same, still standing in the area. The German people had a strict 
  curfew imposed on them by the Allied forces. Anyone caught outside his or her 
  house from sundown to sunup could be shot. We argued among ourselves whether 
  it was could be shot or would be shot, and we concluded that it was could be 
  shot. It was something we should have checked with our Battery Headquarters, 
  but that was the last thing we would do. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We staked out places on the truck to sleep and put one 
  man on guard duty. At about 2200 hour, before we fell asleep, we began to hear 
  music, talking, and laughing coming from a store down the street. Several of 
  us walked down to investigate and found a full-fledged party going on. The 
  store was full of GIs and German girls who were drinking wine, and some were 
  dancing to the music. We never did find out what was making the music, because 
  they would not let us in. A well-oiled staff sergeant had made himself the 
  designated guard at the door, and he was already in a belligerent mood. We 
  decided not to make an issue out of our admittance. The soldiers all had 
  sleeve patches of the Fourth Armored Division, but we never saw any of their 
  vehicles. As we started to leave the party, everyone inside started to sing 
  the German song Lili Marlene.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">While in London, we had learned about this song, which 
  was very popular with the GIs. The words are based on a German poem of 1915, 
  and it had great sentimental meaning to German soldiers. Then the British and 
  American troops picked it up during World War II. It was sung extensively 
  during the war in both German and English. It had a very haunting melody that 
  transcended which side of the war you were on. There were several parodies of 
  the song written later for propaganda purposes by the British that mocked the 
  German battle losses, but the original version is still the best. Its lyrics 
  went as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Underneath the lantern by the barrack gate, Darling I 
  remember the way you used to wait, 'Twas there that you whispered tenderly, 
  That you loved me, You'd always be, My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili 
  Marlene.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Time would come for roll call, Time for us to part, 
  Darling I'd caress you and press you to my heart, And there 'neath that far 
  off lantern light, I'd hold you tight, We'd kiss "good-night," My Lili of the 
  lamplight, My own Lili Marlene. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Orders came for sailing somewhere over there, All 
  confined to barracks was more than I could bear; I knew you were waiting in 
  the street, I heard your feet, But could not meet, My Lili of the lamplight, 
  My own Lili Marlene.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Resting in a billet just behind the line, Even tho' 
  we're parted your lips are close to mine; You where that lantern softly glows, 
  Your sweet face seems to haunt my dreams, My Lili of the lamplight, My own 
  Lili Marlene.1</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We stopped long enough to listen to the song, and it 
  soon generated a strong feeling of nostalgia in us. It was surprising how a 
  song affected our mood. When it was over, we went back to our truck to spend 
  the night with a feeling we had not experienced in some time. It was as if we 
  had just received a letter from home telling about all the good things 
  happening there. Before we fell asleep, we discussed the irony of GIs singing 
  a German song, especially in a German city. Dillon commented, “If they start 
  into Deutschland Uber Alles (Germany above all.), maybe we should go back and 
  check their dog tags.” </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next morning, we drove around looking for someone 
  associated with our outfit. When we found one of the other gun sections in our 
  battalion, we were able to contact the Battery-D Headquarters. The battalion’s 
  gun sections had been scattered out throughout the city (See Fig. 113). We 
  joined up with our machine gun crew and were assigned to a gun site on the bank 
  of the Main River, right in the middle of the city. The river was in a 
  confined channel with concrete walls on the sides. Next to the river on both 
  sides was a fifty-foot wide level area of ground. Then, on both sides, there 
  was a twenty-foot-high wall, behind which was a street. Beyond the streets 
  were three-and four-story buildings. It was similar to the Chicago River as it 
  flows through the Loop, only the buildings in Frankfurt were not as tall. 
  There were a lot of churches in this area, and their steeple spires, or, in 
  some cases what was left of the spires, were sticking up among the damaged 
  buildings.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><img border="0" alt="40mm gun in Frankfurt" src ="images/40mm_gun_Frankfurt_Building_19_113.jpg" width=500 height=420 ></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We dug our gun in along the bank of the river and set 
  the sand bags in place. We pitched the two tents against the wall with the 
  street above and then set up our cots. The trucks were parked next to the 
  tents. The M-51 mount was set up in the middle of a small pedestrian bridge 
  over the river, just downstream from us. The civilians were not allowed to 
  cross on this bridge, and the mount took up most of its width. Again, we did 
  not know what we were protecting at this site. All the other bridges we could 
  see in either direction, were destroyed either by the Allied bombers or by the 
  retreating Germans.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A lot of civilians were around during the day. They 
  would walk down a ramp from the street to the bank of the river. The two tents 
  were just below this ramp wall. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">One day we got some fresh rations that included pork 
  chops. It was a rare treat, and we cooked them over an open grill. The smell 
  from the roasting meat was passing up and over the ramp. We looked up and 
  there were about a dozen civilians looking down at the meat being cooked. 
  Fresh meat was a rarity in Germany.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">There was a ferryboat docked about thirty yards upstream 
  of our gun emplacement, where the civilians crossed the river. Unlike most of 
  our other locations, this place was very active, and there was a lot to see. A 
  searchlight crew was located about two hundred feet downstream of us on the 
  same side of the river as we were. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When we were all settled in, three of us went out to 
  explore the neighborhood. Right behind our gun position, away from the river 
  and up near the road, was an impressive-looking four-story building with 
  minimal damage. Members of the searchlight crew, who had been there a few days 
  longer than us, told us to be sure and check it out. They were somewhat vague 
  about what we would find there. Mounted over the front entrance of the 
  building was a large plaque made of bronze depicting a screaming eagle holding 
  a wreath surrounding a swastika. We went in and found it had been the local 
  Gestapo Headquarters. The inside of the building was even more impressive than 
  the outside but in a very austere manner. There were a lot of papers scattered 
  about, and many of them had Nazi swastika symbols on them. There was an 
  oversized atrium in the middle with a very large staircase. The building had 
  no visible structural damage but most of the windows had been blown out. We 
  commented it had to be a government building because the halls, staircases, 
  and open areas took up most of the floor space. It appeared the architect’s 
  main objective was to create a grandiose appearance with usable office space 
  being a minor consideration. It was a very severe looking but impressive 
  building that reeked of military opulence. While checking out the upper 
  stories of the building, we found it had been heavily looted so we decided to 
  go down into the basement to see what was there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Using flashlights, we went down the staircase. There, 
  off a large main hall were three massive steel doors leading into conference 
  rooms. The doors looked like something out of a bank vault, about a foot 
  thick, with massive hinges and latches. This lower level had evidently been 
  used as an air raid shelter, because there were stocks of food supplies lying 
  about in the hallway. It was a very eerie looking place and it began to make 
  us feel uncomfortable. We had our rifles ready to fire even though there was 
  little chance anyone was down there. There was something about the place that 
  spelled trouble. Later, I realized it too closely resembled the Gestapo 
  buildings we had seen in American movies; only this was the real thing. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial">From the doorways of the rooms, we panned inside with 
  our flashlights. We saw desks, plush chairs, bookcases, maps, and pictures. 
  One of the pictures was of Hitler and there were Nazi<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="German Grenade - Potato Masher" vspace="8" src="images/German_Grenade_Potato_Masher_19_114.jpg" width="220" align="right" height="348"> flags draped on several 
  walls. It did not appear that Hitler’s picture had been defaced. That was a 
  good indicator other GIs who had been in this area before us had not venture 
  into the rooms. This should have rung a warning bell but it didn’t. We picked 
  up a couple of German hand grenades that were lying on the floor near one of 
  the doors. They were called potato mashers because of their shape (See Fig.
  114a). In one of the training films we had seen on how to detect booby traps 
  back in the States, this type of grenade had been shown. This kicked in a new 
  fear factor. Suddenly it dawned on us like a bolt of lightning. The reason 
  these rooms had not already been looted by GIs: they were afraid of 
  booby-traps. Of all the places we would be during the war, this basement 
  stronghold held the greatest potential for this, and we suddenly became very 
  nervous. We stopped what we were doing and froze in position, convinced of the 
  great potential for danger. We began to worry about making our exit. It took 
  us a few minutes before we moved again. We were not ready to sacrifice our 
  lives to satisfy the prospect of getting some great souvenirs. Now, the 
  problem was, how did we get out of there safely? One of the two flashlights 
  started to flicker from a dying battery, which made it even harder to 
  navigate. Every step down the hall and up the stairs was done with great 
  caution. We tried to avoid the debris on the floor and to check for thin 
  tripwires, nearly invisible even under good lighting conditions. It took us 
  about three times as long to get out of the place as it did to go in. We had 
  not been down there long, and I for one was glad to get back upstairs. We 
  checked out the rest of the building again before leaving.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We made other trips over to the Gestapo building while 
  we were in Frankfurt and that uneasy feeling returned each time, even though 
  we always stayed away from the basement. One of those classic Army rumors 
  began to circulate between the searchlight crew near us and our gun crew. The 
  idea the basement might be booby-trapped had now become it definitely was 
  booby-trapped. There were many great souvenirs down there for anyone who had 
  the nerve or stupidity to go in and get them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Some days later, we saw the searchlight crew coming out 
  of the building carrying the flags, pictures, rifles, maps, and other items we 
  had seen in the basement (See Fig. 114b). They had decided to<img border="0" hspace="8" vspace="10" src="images/Nazi_Flag_19_114b.jpg" width="380" align="right" height="583"> ignore all caution and go into 
  the vault rooms. We wondered if the reason they perpetrated the rumor about 
  the basement being booby-trapped was because they wanted to scare us away and 
  leave the taking of souvenirs for them. We envied their loot but did not give 
  them high marks for intelligence. As we got to know these crewmembers, we 
  marveled at their lack of military decorum and their casualness about what 
  they were supposed to be doing. Most of them were out of uniform in one way or 
  another, some badly needed shaves, most of them did not wear their helmets at 
  any time, and there was always a card game out in the open with four or more 
  participating. They were all openly hostile about officers in general, and 
  they talked like they were members of the Mafia. Their vocabularies were 
  reminiscent of Sergeant Monteleone and his cadre members who had given us our 
  initial training in the States. We had not met anyone quite like them before, 
  and we were never sure how to react to them. They had been involved in the 
  North African campaign, the Allied invasion of southern France, and the Third 
  Army’s move through northern France and now Germany. They might have been 
  called battle weary but operating a searchlight could be only marginally 
  classified as participating in battles. We wondered if their long period of 
  time in combat zones had anything to do with their demeanor or if they were 
  just a bunch of thugs who wound up in the same crew.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">After our first Gestapo investigation off the building, 
  we continued on downstream along the bank of the river for about a mile to 
  where the buildings facing the river changed from offices to single-family 
  homes. They were large mansions lining the river and had all sustained 
  considerable damage. We walked up to one large home that was about 
  seventy-five percent destroyed and looked like no one could possibly live 
  there. The patio doors to a large atrium were blown in, so we went inside the 
  house. The roof was almost completely gone, and the place was a mess from 
  being exposed to the weather for many months. Heavy layers of soot and debris 
  covered the plush furniture, rugs and everything else in the room. There was a 
  strong smell of mold and decay. <br>
  I spotted several large and ornate tankards (beer mugs) sitting on the mantle 
  of a huge fireplace and, working my way through the debris, headed over to 
  appropriate them. Even though they were well covered with dust, there was no 
  mistaking their ornate designs and I wanted to beat my buddies to them. At 
  this point in our Army life, our consciences had been greatly dulled. 
  Everything we saw while we were in Germany that was not positively identified 
  as belonging to someone there to claim it was now fair game to be taken as a 
  souvenir or to make our life a little easier. Our basic belief of thou shall 
  not steal had been replaced with all is fair in love and war – or, at least, 
  the war part. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As I reached for one of the tankards, someone behind me 
  said, “May I help you?” Bernal, Le Claire and I were all startled to see a man 
  about fifty years old standing at the far end of the very large room. We had 
  spun around while grabbing our rifles to point at him, but we soon realized 
  that he was not a threat to us. He introduced himself as the owner of the 
  house–or to be more specific, the part of the house that was left–and told us 
  he was living in the basement. I suppose we should have been embarrassed to be 
  caught trying to loot someone’s home while it was still occupied, but we were 
  not. It is hard to explain this attitude looking back, but we had grown 
  callous from seeing so much destruction. We did not differentiate between 
  private property belonging to someone else (after all, they were the enemy) 
  and that which was free for the taking (by us, the conquerors). Also, we 
  assumed that it was open season in destroyed or nearly destroyed buildings, 
  although we had not yet stooped to armed robbery, even of German civilians.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The man spoke perfect English with a slight British 
  accent. He told us he had been educated in England and that he once owned an 
  apartment in London. Even though his clothing were soiled and wrinkled, he 
  still looked and talked like a person of obvious wealth and position. He had 
  an arrogant manner about him, but not so arrogant he was going to provoke the 
  three armed men standing in front of him. His voice was cold and authoritarian 
  and it occurred to me he might be a German officer disguised in civilian 
  clothes. However, his words were anti government and he said he had opposed 
  Hitler and all that went with him. “I’m not a Nazi,” he repeated several 
  times. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We didn’t know whether to believe him or not, because 
  all the Germans we had met rattled on about being “Nix Nazi.” The expression 
  had become a joke in any language and the English version did not ring with 
  any more truth than it did in German. We wondered, where have all the Nazis 
  gone with their dream of a thousand year Reich? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The man then began to tell us about his living 
  conditions. “I spent most of the winter months in bed because there was no 
  fuel for heat. Without electricity, it was always dark in the basement. I 
  still have to walk several miles to get water and there is almost no food 
  available.” </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I don’t know if he was looking for pity or if he wanted 
  us to help him. We were neither curious nor even faintly interested in what he 
  had to say. His story was creating tension in the room, and we were anxious to 
  get out of there. We realized by this time we should not have entered the 
  house, and we were tired of hearing his sob story and more “Nix Nazi.” We 
  started to move toward the area where we came in while the man continued to 
  talk. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">He told us his son was downstairs in the basement and 
  that he had been wounded on the Russian front, although he called it the 
  Eastern front. We wondered if the son might be a deserter because, from the 
  way the man described his condition, he should have been in a hospital. Also, 
  how did he get here from the Russian front, which was hundreds of miles away? 
  The man asked us if we had any medicine or bandages. We had our little 
  first-aid packets attached to our gun belts that contained bandage gauze and 
  sulfa powder, but we had no spares and did not give them to him. He told us 
  that his wife and daughter had been killed by bombs in an air raid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As we were leaving (without the tankards), I could not 
  help but remember that the Nazis–and perhaps the man we had just seen was one 
  of them–had started the war that brought such havoc to the world. The chaotic 
  existence going on in the house where the owner was forced to live in the 
  rubble, his wife and daughter dead, and son badly wounded and without proper 
  medical attention were glaring examples of the penalty the German people were 
  paying for the chaos they had caused throughout many countries, including 
  their own. Maybe it wasn’t fair to pass judgment on all the German people, but 
  without someone to differentiate between the good and the bad, we had to take 
  them to be all bad. Certainly, the odds were better with that assumption 
  because it took a lot of people to run the Nazi machine. The incident caused 
  some very mixed emotions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">
  From that experience, we better understood where all the civilians lived in 
  the bombed areas: any place they could, including in a lot of basements. We 
  had not seen any temporary housing for the Germans, so these partially 
  destroyed buildings were the only shelter available to them. It was live there 
  or camp out in the open. Also, like the man we had just met, I am sure the 
  civilians wanted to guard the few personal treasures they had left. There were 
  millions of people in Europe living this way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We headed back to the gun position. On the way, we 
  discussed the civilian we had just encountered in the bombed-out house. We 
  wondered what a person like that did for the many years Germany was building 
  their war machine before and during the war. He certainly wasn’t sitting 
  around doing nothing. In a totalitarian government like Germany’s, you were 
  either with them or against them, and those against them would not be living 
  in a house like that. Maybe we were justifying our action, but we also 
  believed it to be the truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">What we did not discuss among ourselves or even think 
  about at the time was what the man thought about us. After all, we had been 
  the ones who invaded his private home, armed to the teeth, with the intent of 
  looting it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When we got back to the gun pit, we got word over the 
  phone that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died of a stroke on April 12th 
  and that the Vice President, Harry S. Truman, was sworn in as his replacement. 
  We discussed the matter, but did not feel it would have any effect on us. It 
  was unfortunate Roosevelt would not see the end of the war in which he played 
  such an important role. While Roosevelt had been the Commander-in-Chief of the 
  armed forces, most of us thought of him more in terms of being a politician. 
  There was some feeling of sadness, but no tears were shed. This lack of 
  sentiment may have had something to do with our young ages, but we had seen so 
  much death not even the passing of our national leader could generate much 
  sadness. Most of the younger men in the crew knew little to nothing about 
  politics or even about Roosevelt’s great deeds during the Great Depression. We 
  knew absolutely nothing about Truman at the time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next day at about mid-afternoon the sky filled with 
  B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators flying at an altitude of 
  approximately 20,000-feet. Both types of planes were heavy four-engine 
  American bombers. We started to count them but there were too many. We 
  estimated the number at a thousand. It was an amazing sight that probably 
  would never be duplicated again in history. We had been sitting around the 
  gun, scanning the sky, hoping to see some enemy planes but they all belonged 
  to the Allies. Some city in Germany was in for an awful beating that day and 
  we better understood why most of the towns we had seen in Germany had been 
  laid to ruin. They were headed in the general direction of Berlin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">It was interesting to watch how the civilians who passed 
  near our gun pit acted. It was as if they wanted to stare at this phenomenon, 
  but it was too threatening to look at for very long. They would look up for 
  several seconds and then jerk their heads down as their faces contorted into 
  expressions of fright. They must have had mixed feelings about the situation. 
  These messengers of destruction overhead were not going to bomb their town 
  this day, which was good, but their fellow Germans and possibly relatives were 
  about to be annihilated somewhere else, which was too sad to contemplate. One 
  only had to look around at the destruction in this city to know these people 
  had seen their share of bombings and knew how it felt. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Back in 1943, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had an operation 
  called city busting in force as they sent many air raids against German 
  cities. However, their planes had endured heavy casualties, and they were 
  stopped. After that, the RAF and the American Army Air Force began 
  concentrating on destroying transportation, fuel supply, and industrial 
  facilities with greater success. In late 1944 and early 1945, the focus was 
  back on mass raids of cities with the hope of demoralizing the population. The 
  weakening of the German Luftwaffe and their inability to resist these raids 
  was a major factor in this later decision. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Right next to our tents on the riverbank was a shed that 
  held ten four-man racing shells, sometimes called sculls. Two of our 
  crewmembers took one out on the river and were rowing about. They had 
  quarter-pound TNT packets, complete with firing caps, with them that they 
  lowered down, one at a time, into the river by copper wires. Then they used 
  the battery-operated telephone to crank up an electrical charge to set them 
  off. Each explosion would send a geyser of water about twenty feet up into the 
  air. We crew members all thought it was a lot of fun and the civilians looked 
  on in wonder. Fish that would float to the surface would be scooped up and 
  thrown up on the bank where the civilians would grab them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">One day we were sitting on the sandbags around the gun 
  pit when we heard civilians making some strange noises. They were running down 
  the ramp and over to the ferry. Some of them were letting out moaning sounds, 
  and some had handkerchiefs up to their faces. We went on alert in fear there 
  was some kind of trouble brewing. We soon picked up this unbelievable stench 
  that almost made us gag. We looked up at the roadway and saw there were two 
  hayracks, passing by, each drawn by a team of large Belgian draft horses. 
  Stacked up like cordwood on the racks about five feet high were emaciated 
  bodies. It was a horrible sight and we, like the civilians, turned away from 
  it in repugnance. The wagons moved along at a very slow speed, and it took 
  some time for them to pass out of sight. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We never did find out where they came from or what the 
  purpose was in going through the heart of Frankfurt. There was no sign of an 
  escort of any kind with them. The drivers of the hayracks just stared straight 
  ahead with blank looks on their faces. We wondered how they could tolerate 
  their jobs. The penetrating smell of death was so strong it lingered for some 
  time after the wagons passed. It took even longer for the civilians to settle 
  down as they whispered to each other and gestured with great animation. Some 
  of the women had looked like they were going into shock when they first saw 
  the laden racks. I’m sure the sight of a corpse was nothing new to them with 
  all of the destruction that had occurred to their city but the stacked up 
  emaciated look of these near skeletons was appalling beyond compare. We 
  assumed a concentration camp was someplace in the vicinity, but we were just 
  guessing at that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As we discussed the incident, Armstrong commented 
  philosophically, “The horrible sight we just saw only lasted a few minutes, 
  the smell lasted about half an hour and the memory will stay with us forever.”
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">While we were in Frankfurt, a fellow walked up to us and 
  started talking. He told us he had been a Polish soldier and had been captured 
  by the Germans when they invaded his country in September 1939. He had been a 
  prisoner of war since that time and had recently been released when the 
  American Army overran the camp where he was being held. He spoke in Polish, 
  but because Joe Bernal could speak that language fluently we could communicate 
  with him. He was a very pleasant person, and we decided to help him out. His 
  name was Steve, and we made somewhat of a mascot of him because he wanted to 
  work for us. He stayed with us for several weeks, traveling from one gun 
  position to another, eating what we ate and sleeping in an extra bedroll we 
  furnished him. When the battery cooks brought out a hot meal, we all tried to 
  get a little extra, and then we would share some with Steve. The rest of the 
  time he ate rations like the rest of us, and we always seemed to have extras 
  of those. He was short and thin, but he was as strong as a horse. He told us 
  he was thirty years old, but he looked much older. His face was deeply tanned, 
  hardened, and wrinkled like a man twice that age.. Six years in a German 
  prisoner of war camp evidently had taken its toll. His slight build and thin 
  face accentuated his weather-beaten appearance. But his large brown eyes were 
  sharp and did not have that lifeless look we had seen in many of the 
  ex-prisoners and slave laborers in Europe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">There was something comical about Steve’s appearance. He 
  looked like a ragamuffin with his well-worn, ill-fitting clothes–a mixture of 
  an old Polish Army uniform and prison garb–and a cap he never took off. The 
  military-type cap sat dead center on his head and it came to a point at the 
  top. His boots were laced with rope, he wore no socks, and he seemed to always 
  be stuffing the wax impregnated cardboard from the K-ration boxes into them to 
  cover the holes in the soles. He never removed his boots, his cap or any 
  article of clothes when he slept. This habit was a leftover from his recent 
  prison days. Thievery was a problem in the camp, and the best way to protect 
  the little bit of clothing you had was to never take it off. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Spearing offered to give Steve one of the small woolen 
  knit caps that were part of his Army issue. These caps were designed to be 
  worn under helmets and evidently Spearing had two of them. He made the offer 
  primarily because he thought Steve’s cap looked so ridiculous. Also, it was 
  badly worn and it more than likely had never been cleaned. But, to the 
  surprise of everyone, Steve refused the offer. Later he confided to Bernal 
  that he did not want to be caught having anything American made in his 
  possession. It was well known combat GIs had shot German soldiers who were 
  wearing GI clothing when they were captured. While Steve was not a German, he 
  had no papers to prove he wasn’t and he did not want to take any chances. He 
  still had a long way to go through both American and Russian held territories 
  to reach his home in Poland, his ultimate destination. He did not want to be 
  accused of stealing an article of clothing from a GI, possibly a dead one.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Although Steve was a very quiet person who had been 
  through a lot of hardship, he had not lost his ability to smile and enjoy the 
  comradeship he found with our crew. I always gave him my little packets of 
  cigarettes from the rations and enjoyed seeing the pleasure they gave him. He 
  would beam with delight and give me a slight bow, even standing up to do so if 
  he had been sitting. Before sitting down, he would take off his cap and sweep 
  it across his bowed body in an exaggerated gesture. The only thing he had 
  gotten from his captors was two meager meals a day, and his description of 
  prison food was nauseating. There was nothing sent from his home or any 
  charitable organization. In fact, he had not had a word from his family or 
  anyone else since he was captured. He would not discuss the details of his 
  family or exactly where he came from in Poland so we did not press the issue.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Without really realizing it at the time, I later felt 
  helping Steve was the little morale booster our crew needed. While he was with 
  us, everyone seemed to be in a better mood and the old bantering among 
  ourselves, that we had been short on lately, returned. Steve was just one of 
  the millions of displaced persons in Europe who needed help, and in aiding him 
  at least we were doing something, however small. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">All Steve wanted to do was work and we tried to keep him 
  busy, but there were times when we ran out of assignments. He seemed to become 
  restless when this happened. When we were in a convoy or when the brass was 
  around, we hid him. Obviously, he had a very strong dislike for all Germans 
  because of the harsh treatment his captors had given him. The thing he wanted 
  most was to have a gun. This would later become a problem for us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Not The Right Way To Attend Church</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When Sunday came around, the church bells in the city 
  began to chime. Bernal, Le Claire, Steve, and I set out looking for a Catholic 
  church. We crossed the river on the pedestrian bridge and headed for what 
  looked like a large cathedral several blocks away. People were going in for 
  mass, so we followed. A hole in the roof had been patched and the rest of the 
  building was in fairly good condition. It was one of those large gothic 
  churches that had been built centuries ago. It had a soaring vaulted ceiling 
  with wood beams that flowed down into ornate wooden paneled walls. A field of 
  blazing candles lit up one corner of the church and the confessionals were the 
  size of a small house. It had to be a cathedral because of its size and 
  majesty. I had never seen anything like it before. The stained glass windows 
  had been replaced with clear glass. Whether it had been done before the area 
  had been bombed or after they had been blown out, we did not know. There was a 
  magnificent organ off to the right of the church with bellows reaching to the 
  roof. It was right under the repaired roof and it was badly water stained. The 
  church was already crowded, and we had to go down the main aisle about halfway 
  in order to find a seat. On the way, we were stuffing our bandoleers of 
  ammunition into our jackets. We could see and feel many eyes were focusing on 
  us. It was a long walk to our pew, and the uneasiness we felt made it seem 
  like a mile. Once again, as we did in Woippy, France, we were trying to do the 
  impossible: armed soldiers trying to look inconspicuous in a church among a 
  congregation of civilians. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When we got into the pew, we had to find some place for 
  our rifles, helmets, and gas masks. It wasn’t easy. The mass was said in 
  Latin, like all masses at that time, so we had no trouble following most of 
  the service. There was something nostalgic about watching the priest in his 
  robes and the altar boys in their surplices move about near the altar in a 
  manner we had seen thousands of times. Each Latin phrase the priest spoke out 
  loud, like Domine non sum dignus, had a hometown ring to it. I had picked up a 
  Missal in the pew from habit but soon realized it was a translation of Latin 
  to German, which was of no help to me. There were two elderly women in the pew 
  with us. Out of the corner of my eye, I watched them looking at out rifles 
  lying on the floor behind the kneeler. When I looked over at them, they would 
  jerk their heads back to their prayer books. What, I thought, you’ve never 
  seen an M-1 in church before? Probably not. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The church was crowded and the only empty seats I could 
  see were the two or three places on each side of the four of us where the 
  civilians were giving us a wide berth. We were not sure if it was because we 
  were the enemy or because they thought we were heathens for bringing arms into 
  the church. Maybe it was both. However, we did not dwell on the fact. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When it came time for the gospel and sermon, a 
  Franciscan friar, who was not the priest saying the mass, came out from behind 
  the altar and mounted the pulpit with gusto. It was located on the left side 
  of the church, about halfway back. He was a huge man with a physical presence 
  one would not soon forget. He probably weighed three hundred pounds and there 
  was an air about him that was somewhere between authoritative and pompous. He 
  wore the brown hooded habit of the Franciscan Order that hung 
  down to his ankles. Its symmetry was broken only by a white cord wrapped 
  around his middle where a waist should have been. There was no public address 
  system, but he did not need one because he had a loud, booming voice. He spoke 
  in German, so we were unable to understand him. The reading of the gospel and 
  the guttural tone of his voice told us this was a man who preached fire and 
  brimstone. For the sermon, he started out in a normal tone but was soon 
  ranting in a loud voice that made him sound like Hitler during one of his 
  dramatic oratories. He was very theatrical as he waved his arms to accentuate 
  each point he was making. When he put his right arm out alone, he looked like 
  he was making a Nazi salute. Le Clare was sitting next to me and I wanted to 
  whisper something to him about the friar’s dramatics, but I though better of 
  it and said nothing. While I never would have admitted it, this man had me 
  intimidated. About halfway through the sermon, we heard many of the people 
  around us begin to cry and noticed they were quite upset. Handkerchiefs were 
  being used to dab at watering eyes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When we got back outside of the church after the mass, 
  Steve, who spoke German, told us the priest had told the congregation they had 
  only themselves to blame for all of the destruction and hardship they were 
  experiencing. He said Hitler could not have done what he did without the 
  support of the civilian population and they should have risen up against him. 
  We discussed this idea on our way back and concluded it would have been 
  difficult, if not impossible, for the civilian population of Germany to 
  overthrow their totalitarian government. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Back at the 40mm gun, we spent our time scanning the sky 
  and trying to keep from getting bored. It was a lot easier to stay busy at 
  this site, because there were a lot of people around to watch and to comment 
  about. Sergeant Kornich came by one day and told me one of the gun section 
  leaders was being sent home for personal reasons, and I was being considered 
  for his job. When he left, I was running through my mind reasons to tell him 
  why I did not want the assignment if it was offered to me. Starting over with 
  a new crew at this stage of the war did not interest me, just for one more 
  stripe. It was a choice I would not have to make as things unfolded later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Most of the civilians passing to and from the ferry did 
  not talk to us. They just looked at us with mild curiosity. One woman did stop 
  and tell she was an American who had been trapped in Germany when the war 
  started. She said she was from Georgia and was a Georgia Cracker, not a 
  Georgia Peach. When young ladies passed, we would say something to them, but 
  they would just smile or ignore us altogether. We had been warned that we were 
  not supposed to fraternize with German civilians unless it was for official 
  business. It was a rule we took lightly. Everywhere we went, the rule was 
  being broken and from our limited observations, it was not being enforced. Our 
  assumption in this matter was soon to be proven wrong.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Learning The "No-Fraternizing" Rule The
  Hard Way</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">One day two young women stopped to talk with us. They 
  said they were Austrian, and they too had been stuck in Germany since the 
  beginning of the war. One spoke fluent English. They told us about conditions 
  in Frankfurt and how they were looking forward to going back to Austria, even 
  if it was badly torn up. Armbruster took a picture of me with my arms around 
  one of the girls while we were standing next to the river (See Fig. 115). The 
  girls stayed only for about ten minutes and then they left to board the ferry.
  </font></p>
  <p><img border="0" alt="Bob Gallagher Fraternizing with the enemy" src ="images/Bob_Gallagher_Fraternizing_with_Enemy_19_115.jpg" width=483 height=662 ></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Then a Jeep pulled up with a Lieutenant Harrison and his 
  driver in it. He had been watching us with binoculars from across the river. 
  He told Le Claire and me we had been fraternizing with the enemy, which was 
  against regulations. Actually, we all had been talking with the two girls, and 
  they really weren’t the enemy. We told him they weren’t even Germans, but he 
  would not listen to us. <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">He
  left our site and arranged to have both Le Claire and myself loose our
  stripes.</span> The purpose, supposedly, was to set an example 
  for the rest of the battalion. The theory was if it could happen to soldiers 
  who had no previous trouble, it could happen to anyone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I lost my corporal stripes, and Le Claire lost his one 
  stripe. The two of us were really upset, and even after all the years that 
  have passed since it happened, I still get mad thinking about it. Overall, it 
  didn’t make any difference in our duties. We just got a little less pay, but 
  since there was no place to spend it, that didn’t matter either. It was the 
  injustice of making us scapegoats that wasn’t right. The no fraternizing rule 
  was the most abused regulation ever put out by the Army, and the GIs openly 
  flaunted it on a wholesale level. Everyone was talking to the civilians and in 
  a few months time, some GIs would be marrying them. If their intention in
  taking our stripes was to stop the soldiers from talking to the Germans, it 
  didn’t work. We, and all the GIs we saw, talked to them every day. Later, we 
  heard from GIs in the Headquarters Battery about parties held in Frankfurt 
  with some of our officers and the local frauleins in attendance. Also, we 
  remembered the party we had observed with men from the Fourth Armored Division 
  and local girls just a few nights previous.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Le Clair and I were not the only men in our outfit who
  lost their stripes for fraternizing. We learned later the usual punishment 
  in other outfits for this offense was just a warning or a monetary fine. A 
  court martial was highly unusual. It definitely was not uniformly enforced. 
  The average GI looked at the restriction on fraternizing as being similar to 
  the act of prohibition against liquor earlier in the century. Everybody 
  fraternized and, in this case, an overzealous officer caught the unlucky ones. 
  The rule looked good on paper to some rear echelon brass hats but was 
  basically unenforceable in the field.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">I was reminded of a saying from our early days of 
  training: military justice is to justice what mess hall chow is to fine 
  cuisine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The members of the searchlight crew were enraged by Le 
  Claire’s and my experience with the officers. They seemed more upset 
  about it than we were. They used the words chicken s--- bastard and some much 
  worse profanities in describing Lieutenant Harrison. We had seen members of 
  the searchlight crew on several occasions talking to some young ladies and 
  openly fraternizing with the civilian population on many occasions. They could 
  not understand that it was outlawed by Army regulations much less that our own 
  officers were enforcing it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A few days after our experience with Lieutenant
  Harrison, the searchlight crew 
  told us an interesting story about an incident at the Gestapo Headquarters. 
  Evidently, there were a couple of young ladies who had set up shop over there 
  on the fourth floor and they were taking on anyone who was interested. The 
  price for favors furnished was one pack of cigarettes. We had noticed the 
  heavy traffic going into the building including most of the searchlight 
  crewmembers. On this one particular day, there were two men from their crew up 
  there with the girls when they heard someone roaming through the lower floors. 
  They looked out from their rooms and saw a lieutenant and his T-5 (corporal) 
  driver, who they recognized as being from our outfit, exploring the building. 
  The two crewmembers went out into the fourth floor hall overlooking the 
  staircase next to the atrium and lay down there in a prone position. They had 
  their rifles ready and were planning on shooting the lieutenant and T-5 if 
  they came up to the fourth floor and discovered them. They had selected who 
  each would shoot whom as a precautionary against succumbing to the same fate 
  as Le Claire and me. We did not doubt their story for a minute because this 
  was a tough bunch of guys. Fortunately, the two men climbing the stairs only 
  got to the third floor. From the description of the Lieutenant they gave, we 
  concluded it was Lieutenant Kraft but we did not know who the driver was. We 
  wondered, “Who are these guys?”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When we were getting ready to leave Frankfurt, the 
  searchlight crew gave us a lot of 10-in-1 rations in cardboard boxes they 
  didn’t need. We loaded them up on our trucks and used them to supplement our 
  regular rations. They contained some items, such as canned date nut bread, 
  fruit cocktail, candy, and cigarettes, which we referred to as goodies. In 
  addition to the newly acquired rations, we kept accumulating all kinds of 
  things like mattresses, chairs, souvenirs, and many other items we were 
  picking up from bombed-out buildings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Our convoy left Frankfurt, and when we bivouacked as a 
  battalion on the night of April 19, there weren’t enough places on the truck 
  for everyone to sleep. Some of the men had to spread their sleeping bags out 
  on the ground. The next day we moved into the town of Hanau, our next 
  location. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Steve went with us.</font></p>
