    <p><font face="Arial">We set our gun up right next to the runway at a large 
    German air base located on the edge of town. We did not dig in. There were 
    many German planes sitting about, some were totally destroyed (See Fig. 134a
    and 134b), some partially destroyed and others in near-perfect condition. A bunch 
    of us climbed on one of them and posed for a picture (See Fig. 135).<br>

  <p><font face="Arial">We played around with several planes, and some of the 
  men in our battalion finally got an FW-180 to start up. At first, they were 
  going to taxi it around, but they decided not to because it might have been 
  dangerous. There were American C-47 transport planes landing on the airstrip on 
  a regular basis. They were coming in to fly out American prisoners of war who 
  had just been liberated from a camp, called a stalag, somewhere nearby. 
  Hundreds of Allied ex-prisoners were milling about the area, and many of them 
  looked quite emaciated. The Air Force was flying out the sickest</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Nazi Propaganda Card - Adolph Hitler" vspace="10" src="images/Adolph_Hitler_22_136.jpg" width="197" align="right" height="360"><font face="Arial"> troops while 
  the healthier ones were being taken by truck. We stayed overnight in barracks. 
  The American engineers had fixed up one building with showers, and, after 
  waiting in line for over an hour, we finally got our turn.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">On April 30th, 1945, Adolf Hitler (See Figs. 136 and 137 
  ) committed suicide as the Russian Army was advancing on Berlin, but we heard 
  none of this until some time later. To us, the war was still very much alive.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Danube Wasn't Blue</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">On May 1, we moved into the heart of Regensburg. We set 
  our gun up right on the edge of the Danube River, which runs through the town 
  in a confined concrete channel like the Main River did in Frankfurt. Our gun 
  was set up about ten feet from the wall that defined one of the banks. We were 
  sitting on a concrete slab, so there was no way to dig in. In fact, everything 
  in the area was paved with concrete. After unloading both trucks, we sent a 
  crew out to find some material suitable to fill sand bags. They found it, 
  loaded up the bags, brought them back, and set them up around the 40mm and 
  M-51 mount to make gun pits.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The immediate area had been a loading dock for ships. 
  About a hundred yards upstream was a large gantry crane about fifty feet high 
  for loading ships, and behind it, away from the river, were <img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Hitler in German Ruins" vspace="10" src="images/Hitler_views_German_ruins_22_137.jpg" width="301" align="left" height="466"> badly bombed-out 
  storage sheds that extended for blocks. Looking downstream, a ramp led to a 
  street perpendicular to the river. It had been the major street in that area 
  of the city and led across the river. No one was crossing at this point, 
  however, because the large steel truss bridge that spanned the river was half 
  in and half out of the water. The entire upper portion of the bridge, 
  including trusses and deck, were intact but had been knocked off their pier at 
  one end, indicating they probably had been sabotaged by the retreating German 
  troops rather than bombed by Allied planes. Our M-51 machine gun crew set up 
  right in the middle of the street at the top of the ramp. They were about two 
  hundred feet from our 40mm gun pit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Searching For Living Quarters</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Once we were settled in with our gun emplacement, we 
  started to look around for a place to stay. We would not be able to pitch our 
  two tents anywhere close, because we could not drive stakes into concrete. 
  Considering the damage to the neighborhood and the bridge, we concluded there 
  had been a lot of bombing in this area. The nearby buildings were all painted 
  with camouflage colors in an overall attempt to hide the dock area. Most of 
  them, except for the storage sheds located farther down the dock, were 
  residential. The buildings were heavily pocked from flying projectiles and 
  there wasn’t a pane of intact glass to be seen. Immediately inland from the 
  gun was a two-story residential building. It seemed to be in good structural 
  condition. We thought there were people in it but we could not be sure. There 
  was some kind of blue/gray cloth hanging over the window frames on the inside 
  in place of the missing glass.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Spearing and I were given the assignment of seeing what 
  could be done about occupying it while we were at this site. There was no talk 
  about compensating the owner using billet slips like we had while in Hanau. It 
  was important we find some place nearby to billet or we would be spending all 
  of our off-hours in the backs of our trucks. This put a high priority on the 
  matter and proper procedure, not to mention consideration of civilian rights, 
  did not seem all that important. We went around to the other side of the 
  building and up a flight of stairs to a door. We knocked, but nobody answered. 
  Using the butts of our rifles, we knocked even harder. We could hear people 
  inside, and I’m sure that we sounded like the Gestapo to them. Finally, a man 
  opened the door. He was about thirty-five years old and we immediately 
  wondered why he was still a civilian. He was scared to death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Spearing had been raised in a family with German 
  immigrant parents and he surprised me with his linguistic skills I had no idea 
  he possessed. He told the man “Wis Möchten Ihre Wohnungen für einige Tage 
  benutzen.” (“We would like to use your apartment for several days.”)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When Spearing told me what he had said, I told him 
  “You’re going to have to get a lot tougher than that, Mel.” </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The man kept saying, “Nix Nazi; nix Nazi,” which is what 
  all of the German civilians said when they talked to us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Spearing then said “Sie werden heraus umziehen müussen.” 
  (“You’re going to have to move out.”) <br>
  Then the man’s wife came to the door with two children, a boy about six and a 
  girl about four. They were all crying. I had seen the mother hit the girl on 
  the back of her head as they approached the door, and it was a hard enough 
  blow to make anyone cry.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Spearing and I were about to abandon the whole idea when 
  the husband said something to his wife about his relatives upstairs. We went 
  up to the second floor and knocked on that door. An elderly woman answered, 
  and Spearing told her we had some company for her: the people downstairs. It 
  did not seem to faze her. We went back downstairs and told the family of four 
  “Sie haben 20 minuten zum Gehen.” (You have 20 minutes to go.”) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We came back in that time and took over the apartment. 
  We put a ladder up to one of the windows over on the riverside to use for 
  ingress and egress (See Fig. 138).<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><img border="0" alt="Building near Danube River" src ="images/Danube_River_Building_22_138.jpg" width=550 height=409 ></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">It was a typical small European apartment with a 
  living/dining room area, a tiny kitchen, one bedroom, and one bath (not 
  operational). We moved all the living/dining room furniture into the bedroom 
  and set up our fifteen Army cots in the main room. They abutted each other, 
  and nearly filled the room. To get around in some areas, we had to walk on the 
  wooden cot frames. We<img border="0" hspace="6" alt="Nazi Propaganda Poster" vspace="6" src="images/Nazi_Progaganda_Poster_22_139.jpg" width="256" align="right" height="462"> placed our bedrolls on the cots to sleep in and folded 
  the blankets for pillows. We would remove our boots and jackets when going to 
  bed but, as usual, we slept in our clothes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The only two windows in the apartment looked right out 
  at our gun position next to the river. It was an ideal location for us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">While looking around the apartment, we found literature, 
  banners, and flags that all had swastikas on them. If the owner wasn’t a Nazi, 
  he sure had all the trappings of one. We concluded, maybe to justify our 
  consciences, that he may have been a Nazi official, which would answer the 
  question of why he wasn’t in the armed forces. His wife was a tailor. There 
  were bolts of army blue-gray uniform material, a sewing machine, and military 
  insignias in a closet. They had used material from the bolts of cloth to cover 
  the windows where all of the glass had been blown out. I picked up a stack of 
  Nazi propaganda cards at his site (See Fig. 139, 140, 141, 142a and 142b ).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The rest of the crew was ribbing Spearing and me about 
  evacuating the family. They would give us the Nazi salute and say, “Heil 
  Hitler,” when they passed us. The ribbing didn’t bother us, but our 
  consciences were killing us. We decided to give the family a present. Neither 
  Spearing nor I smoked, so we had a lot of those little four- cigarette packets 
  from rations saved up. We took about ten of them along with five candy bars 
  and put them in a little bag. We then went over to the truck and picked up a 
  couple boxes of 10-in-1 rations. We went to the second floor apartment and 
  gave them to the family. With the packages being wrapped, they did not know 
  what we were giving until they opened them later.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial">The next day, the man from upstairs came down to the gun 
  pit with his little girl and thanked us. He was beaming from ear to ear while 
  he chattered in German. Steve, the Polish ex-POW, was interpreting for us. We 
  figured the civilian would have made a good (Nazi) party member because of his 
  solicitous manner. He kept using the word kamerad, which we hated. We weren’t 
  his comrades, and we didn’t want to be. When he overstayed his welcome, we 
  told Steve to get rid of him, which he was more than happy to do. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Later, I thought that get rid of him might have been the 
  wrong thing to say to Steve. He could have interpreted it to mean shoot him, 
  or dump him in the river. Whatever Steve told the German, his expression 
  changed, and he started to head back around the corner to his new apartment. 
  We gave the little girl some more chocolate bars before they left. Spearing 
  and I felt a lot better about our actions but the Nazi salutes lasted until 
  the crew found someone to tease about something else.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">One evening while we were at this location, I was off 
  duty, lying on my cot. There were about six others in the room, several of 
  them writing letters by candlelight. Bob Armbruster had gotten the candles from 
  home when we were stationed in England. The Army did not issue them so his 
  forward thinking was a great help to us all. Bob was always one step ahead of 
  the rest of us in figuring out what was needed or what would be needed later 
  to make our lives a little more livable. If you needed some soap, toothpaste, 
  or a scissors to trim your hair, Bob could always come up with it in a hurry. 
  He was very generous and always trying to upgrade our living standard from 
  chaotic to livable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The candles in the room were on shelves in two small 
  alcoves at one end of the room. Their flames, with their dim glow, were 
  casting barely visible but eerie shadows on the other walls. There were 
  several men fidgeting on their cots trying to get enough light to write 
  letters home. With fifteen cots crammed together along with our duffel bags, 
  bedrolls, blankets, rifles, helmets, gas masks, and all the rest of our gear, 
  the tiny apartment was a real dump. The place did not look all that great when 
  we arrived. The well-scuffed walls were discolored from age, and looked like 
  they had not been painted or washed in many years. It was hard to distinguish 
  whether they had been painted gray or were dirty white. There were no pictures 
  on the walls, but perhaps the owners had taken them when they left. The room 
  looked the worst at night. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">During the day, we usually moved the drapes to the side 
  to allow some air in, but only for short periods of time. The men who had been 
  on guard duty or manning the gun during the night were now trying to catch up 
  on their sleep. They wanted the drapes closed to keep the room in semi 
  darkness. From being closed up so often, the place was taking on the foul 
  smell of body odor and dirty laundry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As hard as it is to understand today, nobody complained 
  about the conditions because, as we did many other times in the Army, we were 
  comparing one type of living conditions against others we experienced. Here, 
  we had a permanent roof over our head, no mud under foot, and cots to sleep 
  on. It was a lot better than some of the other places we had been and a 
  hundred times better than what a lot of other GIs were experiencing. As our 
  expectations and requirements for living conditions continued to drop to new 
  lows, even being in an apartment we would normally consider a slum was 
  appreciated as though it was fine living. We felt fortunate to have made such 
  a great discovery.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The only other room available in the apartment was the 
  kitchen, and it made the living/dining room look neat. It was about ten feet 
  square with most of the space taken up by a beat-up wooden table and four 
  chairs. The civilians who had vacated the apartment left all kinds of debris 
  in their haste to leave by our schedule. We soon added the clutter of C, K, 
  and 10-in-1 ration boxes, wrappers, tin cans, and miscellaneous waste. Several 
  of us complained about the condition of the apartment, but nobody made any 
  effort to clean it up. Even Bob Armbruster, who was very neat in everything he 
  did, made no effort to improve it. I think we had disappointed him while we 
  were in the house back at St. Goar when we had refused to do KP duty to 
  upgrade our living conditions. He had decided we were beyond salvation, and he 
  was not going to furnish maid service to guys who lived like a bunch of slobs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">One would think the less than sanitary living conditions 
  and the minimal nourishment from eating rations would have resulted in some 
  major health problems. I saw none of this. There were some minor problems but 
  they did not have any lasting effects and no medical treatment was ever 
  required. We were all thriving despite the lack of a wholesome life style.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At about 2300 hours that evening I was lying on my back 
  with my eyes closed as I was drifting off to sleep. Some of the men were 
  sleeping, while others were still writing letters. Crews were manning the 40mm 
  and M-51 Mount outside next to the river. Grimes was in the cot next to me, 
  and I heard him say to Le Claire, who was across the room, “Put out that 
  candle you goddamn frog,” (a derogatory remark for a Frenchman, used because 
  of Le Claire’s ethnic name), “or I’ll shoot it out.” I thought he was kidding, 
  because Le Claire was his favorite target for needling. I opened my eyes to 
  see Grimes, in a prone position on his cot, aiming his M-1 rifle across the 
  room. The end of the gun barrel was situated just a few inches above my eyes. 
  At that moment, he shot the gun, which sounded more like a cannon in the small 
  enclosed room. I got the full blast of the gasses from the end of the barrel 
  right in my face. The pain was severe, I could not open my eyes, and thought I 
  had been blinded. The room filled with shouting as Le Claire and every other 
  man in the room, including me, were lacing Grimes with every curse word we 
  knew. Grimes rolled over on his cot and pretended to be sleeping. No 
  explanation for his action was given. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Fortunately, after several hours, I began to see again, 
  but it took twenty-four hours before my eyes were back to normal. There 
  appeared to be no permanent injury. It was just another dumb stunt by Grimes. 
  The morning after the incident, I still had powder marks on my face that took 
  some hard scrubbing with soap and water to remove.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next day we were manning our gun and looking for 
  enemy planes. All we saw were American and British ones — hundreds of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Allied Ex-POWs Show Up</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As we were sitting around our gun pit, allied prisoners 
  of war who had been recently liberated from a nearby POW camp would walk past 
  on the dock, usually in groups of two or more. There were Americans, Polish, 
  English, and Russian. We would say hello, and some of them would stop and 
  talk. Usually, they requested cigarettes. Steve, our adopted ex-POW, had long 
  conversations with his fellow countrymen from Poland. The Russians would 
  salute us, but they would not stop and we got the impression that they had 
  been ordered not to. They never smiled. Later, when we saw pictures of the 
  first meeting between Russian and American forces at the Elbe River with all 
  the hugging and toasting, we wondered what had happened in the interim to 
  change their attitude.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In the early afternoon two American ex-POWs stopped and 
  asked if we had any food. They said they had not eaten in quite a number of 
  hours. We said we had some rations to share and invited them into our 
  apartment. Dillon and I sat down with them at the kitchen table and offered 
  what we had. They were both aviators who had been shot down over Germany and 
  captured. One was a staff sergeant who had been a gunner on a B-24 Liberator 
  bomber. The other was a second lieutenant who had been shot down on his second 
  bombing mission. The lieutenant seemed to have trouble communicating, and the 
  sergeant did all of the talking for the both of them. I don’t know how the two 
  of them matched up, because the officers and enlisted men were usually kept in 
  separate camps.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The sergeant told us what it was like to be a prisoner 
  of war. He had been interned for well over a year and although the Germans 
  treated him harshly, he saw no acts of cruelty. The quarters he was confined 
  to were extremely cramped and he slept on shelves stacked three high. He said 
  at first it wasn’t too bad and they would get an occasional Red Cross package. 
  But as the war went against the Germans, it had a negative effect on the 
  prisoners. They had gone from a diet of a meager amount of bread, 
  potatoes and an occasional very small amount of meat to one dish of thin soup 
  per day near the end of their confinement. His weight dropped more than fifty 
  pounds, mostly in the last three months. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The sergeant had worked in a German army post office, 
  sorting packages. He and his fellow prisoners would steal cookies and other 
  sweets out of the packages that came through their hands. They received no 
  news about the war, but they knew the Germans were losing when the packages to 
  the German soldiers started to get smaller. Near the end, there would be only 
  one cookie in some of the packages. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">There were Russians in the camp, and the Germans gave 
  them the lousy details. They even used a double standard of punishment by 
  executing the Russians for minor infringements while doling out harsh but 
  non-fatal penalties to the GIs. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The sergeant told us something that happened to the 
  lieutenant several weeks before he was liberated, when things began to get 
  very bad for the POWs. With the Allied Armies closing in on the German 
  territory, the Germans were required to move the American POWs held in 
  outlying camps further into their country. During one of these moves, the 
  lieutenant had been placed in a locked boxcar without proper ventilation. 
  Along the route, Allied planes had strafed and bombed the train. The 
  lieutenant had spent three days in a jam-packed car with his dead and wounded 
  comrades, with nothing to eat or drink. It was then we knew what was making 
  him act so strange.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">During the meal, such as it was, I reached across the 
  table to grab something. The lieutenant reared back in his chair and nearly 
  fell on the floor, reacting as if I was going to hit him. His nerves were 
  completely shot, and he had a wild look in his eyes. He was going to need 
  psychotherapy when he got back to the States. I apologized to him, but it did 
  not seem to register. We gave them each a K-ration when they left.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next day Joe Bernal, Le Claire, and I decided to 
  look around the neighborhood. We walked down the dock to the bombed-out 
  warehouses. We went into an office, and I found a large flag, about four feet 
  by six feet, that had flown from a cargo ship that plied the Danube River. The 
  background of the flag was white, and there was a large black swastika in the 
  middle, with gold stripes radiating up to the corners. It had four letters, 
  one in each quadrant. They stood for Danube Steam Ship Company. I brought the 
  flag home with me after the war, but it was lost some years later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We progressed inland a couple of blocks to what looked 
  like a residential neighborhood. Solid rows of three-story apartment buildings 
  bordered both sides of the street. There was no space between the buildings 
  and many of them had experienced heavy bomb damage. As we looked into the 
  buildings, on one side of the street we were amazed to see airplanes parts 
  sitting there. We went in to get a better look. There were dozens of fuselages 
  of ME-109 fighter planes in various stages of construction. The Germans had 
  broken out the walls between the buildings, and were using the area as an 
  assembly plant. They had resorted to setting up a cottage industry in a 
  desperate attempt to continue the manufacture of munitions. There was no sign 
  of wings, so we assumed they were made somewhere else. This was one of the 
  desperate ways they developed to stay in production when the Allied planes 
  bombed the regular manufacturing plants. They thought by moving into a 
  residential area, they would be safe. Evidently, they were wrong. This also 
  answered the question why residential buildings in this area of town were all 
  painted with camouflage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Years later, I learned the city of Regensburg once had 
  the country’s largest plant for manufacturing the ME-109 plane. It had been 
  bombed and put out of commission by the Allied air force in a series of air 
  raids. One of these raids had resulted in the loss of twenty-four out of the 
  one-hundred-forty-six B-17, Flying Fortress bombers that took part in that 
  raid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We went back onto the street and proceeded through the 
  residential neighborhood where we heard noise off to our left that sounded 
  like a crowd at a sporting event. We turned down a narrow street and had to 
  step aside to allow a woman going in the opposite direction pass us. She was 
  relatively small in size, and balanced on her head was a canvas bag only 
  slightly smaller than the Volkswagen car we had seen in St.Goar. We wondered 
  what could have been in that bag that was so light a frail woman like her 
  could support it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Like A Scene From A Bad Movie</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At the end of the short street, we came to a large 
  square filled with hundreds of people. At the opposite end of the square was a 
  large building with a very ornate fence around it. The fence had a wrought 
  iron gate with a crest on it, and the gate was open. The building was a 
  winery, and it was being looted in a big way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“They were corks!” Joe exclaimed</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“What were corks? was my reply as I stepped out of the 
  way of a drunken GI who almost stumbled into me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“That woman we just passed in the alley. She probably 
  had corks in that bag. There’s nothing lighter than corks.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“Sounds right but her old man will probably shoot her 
  for bringing home some decayed wood when it could have been a nice bottle or 
  two of wine,” I said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">There were mainly GIs, some Allied ex-POWs, and a few 
  civilians moving about. Many of them were carrying bottles or cases of wine, 
  and it was obvious more than a little bit of the grape had been drunk before 
  we got there. Most of the people in sight were still drinking and were in 
  various stages of intoxication. There was much loud talking, shouting, and an 
  unusual show of affection with soldiers having their arms around their 
  comrades’ shoulders. Soldiers only got that chummy when they had way too much 
  to drink. The square had the look of a real drinking party, which was more 
  noticeable to us because we had arrived late and were dead sober.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The GIs taking the wine did not care if it was good 
  quality or not; most of them would not know the difference anyway. They were 
  gulping either directly from bottles or mess kit cups. The only quality 
  criterion was, “Does it give me a buzz?” Words like clarity, full bodied, and 
  exquisite taste were never mentioned. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“I got the Jeep full so let’s get the hell out of here.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“Leon’s too drunk to walk. Come and give me a hand with 
  him.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“I’m gonna shoot that goddamn staff (sergeant) if he 
  gets in my way one more time.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">“Don’t waste time with the bottles, just take cases.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">These were the comment we were hearing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In addition to dozens of GIs carrying bottles and cases 
  of wine, several large casks (about eight feet in diameter by ten feet long) 
  were being rolled along the cobblestone street by GIs. One of the casks was 
  leaking wine from one end and there were several GIs running alongside it with 
  their mess-kit cups outstretched catching the flow. A large group from an 
  infantry unit was laughing uproariously as they blundered through the words of 
  Roll Out The Barrel. It was raining slightly, and the whole square looked like 
  it was a scene from a bad “B” movie. We debated going into the winery, but 
  decided against it. None of us cared much about drinking wine, and there were 
  some fights starting to break out. There was nothing more dangerous than a lot 
  of drunks who were fighting, especially when they were all carrying loaded 
  guns.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As we started to leave the square, a very drunk GI came 
  by carrying a case of wine. As he got near us, he stumbled, and the bottles 
  spilled out all over the cobblestone street. A few of them broke, but most did 
  not. Each of us picked up a bottle and took off. The soldier never knew what 
  we were doing. On our way back to our gun position, we ran into two members of 
  our machine gun crew, Crow and Hughes, who were carrying five-gallon water 
  cans toward the winery. My first thought was, when Hughes gets one of his 
  buss-ons from drinking the wine, the crew will be in for some entertainment 
  just like when he spent evenings drinking beer at the PX back in the States. 
  The two of them were planning on filling up the cans at the winery and then 
  taking them back to their machinegun position. When we got back to the 40mm 
  gun, we gave our bottles to those who liked wine. Then, Wellington headed over 
  to the winery, which was only a few blocks from out gun site, to help the 
  other two members of the machine gun crew load the water cans.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Later that day, Hughes came staggering down the ramp 
  from the mount carrying a five-gallon can in each hand. “Got a present for ya 
  all. Ten gallons of German red and I stomped the grapes myself,” he slurred 
  while trying to hold back a laugh. After setting down the cans, he leaned 
  against the gun pit sandbags to steady himself. He was ready to go into one of 
  his comical routines but he hesitated. The look on Dillon’s face told him this 
  wasn’t the time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Dillon blurted out with more authority than we had heard 
  from him in a long time, “You’d better keep at least one guy sober up there. 
  If there’s any kind of a raid, I don’t want you f---ing it up.” <br>
  Hughes stood up straight, threw his shoulders back, looked indignant, and 
  staggered back up the ramp mumbling, “That’s the thanks I get.” </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Grimes poured out half a cup of wine, took a swig, and 
  announced “Not bad! Not bad at all!” with the faked assuredness of someone who 
  knew what he was talking about.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Dillon picked up the cans and moved them over to the 
  building where we were billeted. On his way there and back to the gun pit he 
  stopped and looked up the ramp at the machine gunners trying to make out what 
  they were up to. He knew he should go up there to see firsthand but he already 
  knew what he would find. They were all drunk and there wasn’t much he could do 
  about it at that stage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">That evening I was on guard duty from 2000 hours until 
  midnight. The weather had turned bad early in the evening and there was a low 
  hanging overcast. With no chance of an aerial attack in that weather, we did 
  not have to man the gun. The rain had just stopped when I started my shift. I 
  decided the best site to observe the area was from one of the windowsills of 
  the apartment. The sills were about six feet above the concrete roadway and 
  were about three feet wide so there was plenty of room. Sitting there, I could 
  look out over my right shoulder and clearly see the 40mm gun. The moonlight, 
  filtering through the low cloud formation, was reflecting off the rushing 
  water of the Danube River, forming a contrasting background for the gun’s 
  silhouette. Overall, it was fairly dark, but not so black I could not see the 
  outlines of other objects. Looking down the river several hundred feet, I 
  could see the bridge. The bridge itself was in fairly good condition, its 
  tipped position made it unusable. I was facing up the ramp, and the machine 
  gun barrels on the M-51 mount were barely outlined against the sky. I could 
  not see the crew, but they were close enough I could hear them. They had been 
  quite noisy earlier as the wine had done its job, but it was quiet now - too 
  quiet. The river was making a loud rushing sound because the water was high in 
  its confined channel from all of the rain we had been getting. The downed 
  truss of the bridge acted as a partial spillway, adding to the noise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At the top of each hour on duty, I climbed down off of 
  the sill and walked the fifteen yards to the telephone in the gun pit to check 
  in with headquarters. Then I returned to the building, scaled the wall and sat 
  back down on the sill. After each check in, I waited nervously to hear if our 
  M-51 crew would answer and wondered what I would do if they didn’t. Crow came 
  through each time, much to my surprise. The only sign of his condition was his 
  elaboration on the basic information he was supposed to give. “Machine gun 
  crew number one reporting; the best goddamn gun section in the Army,” he 
  expounded on one occasion. No one seemed to think anything was unusual about 
  his statement and about half of the gun crews who followed him in sequence 
  added some self-glorification. All adjectives had a profane ring to them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><b>Surprise While On Guard Duty</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At about 2330 hours, I began checking my watch 
  frequently, because I would soon be awakening my replacement. I could not hear 
  anyone talking inside the apartment, although the noise from the river muffled 
  some sounds. I assumed everyone had gone to sleep. Suddenly, I heard voices 
  talking in whispers, barely audible because it was mixed with river noise. At 
  first, I thought it was someone inside the apartment, but I soon realized it 
  was coming from outside. I looked down; standing directly beneath me were two 
  men. I could have reached down and tapped them on top of their heads. It was 
  impossible to determine what they were wearing or who they were. They were 
  just standing there, pointing up toward the M-51 mount, and it did not take me 
  long to realize they were speaking German. My heart about stopped. The only 
  German civilians who were out after dark were up to no good. We had been 
  instructed to challenge anyone we saw and shoot to kill if they fled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When I got my breath back, I started to reach for my 
  gun. If I was going to challenge anybody, I wanted my gun in my hands. It was 
  a .45-caliber Thompson sub machine gun that had been issued to one of our 
  crewmembers (See Fig. 143). Because it was smaller than our rifles and had<img border="0" hspace="6" alt="Thompson Submachine Gun - Bob Gallagher during training" vspace="6" src="images/Thompson_Submachine_Gun_22_143.jpg" width="242" align="right" height="496"> 
  more firepower, we took turns using it on guard duty. I had put it inside the 
  window of the apartment, setting on the floor and leaning toward the window. 
  As I started to reach for it with my left hand, a thin line of light between 
  the bottom of the window frame and the cloth cover told me there was at least 
  one candle still burning inside. If I pushed the drape away from the window to 
  get at the gun, the light would silhouette me against the cloth. I decided to 
  wait and see if the men would move away from me before reaching for the gun. 
  The waiting seemed like a long time, although it was probably only a couple 
  minutes. Questions raced through my mind. Was there a round in the chamber? 
  Where was the safety catch located? Was it on single shot or automatic fire? I 
  hoped the two men would not look up and see me. If they did, I planned to roll 
  into the room and then grab the gun.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Finally, they moved off in the direction from which I 
  believed they had come. I reached into the apartment and grabbed the machine 
  gun, pulled the bolt back until it hit its limit, letting it slam forward as 
  it picked up a cartridge from the clip and forcing a round into the firing 
  chamber. At the same time I released the safety catch and dropped my feet so 
  they were dangling from the windowsill. I fired. The gun was on single shot so 
  I got off about eight rounds, pulling the trigger for each one. I was holding 
  the gun away from me, because I was firing from my left side, and the spent 
  shells were being ejected directly at me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The whole crew inside came awake, and we all jumped down 
  from the two windows onto the concrete outside. There was much excitement as I 
  explained to them what had happened. About then, we heard the distinct 
  whirring noise of the M-51 mount’s turret being turned. The guns that had been 
  silhouetted against the sky were no longer visible and we knew, they were now 
  being aimed in our direction. Then, we really got nervous. We could be killed 
  by our own crewmembers, who we knew had spent most of the evening drinking 
  wine and were quite merry if not downright drunk. Dillon handed me his rifle 
  and went racing up the ramp flapping his arms up and down, yelling, “Don’t 
  shoot, don’t shoot!” </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">After getting the machine guns pointed up in the sky 
  again, we debated what to do next and decided to double the guard. There was 
  no way to pursue the two men, and we never found out who they were. By the 
  time everything calmed down, my guard duty shift was over so I went to bed 
  with the others, although I did not sleep well that night. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The next day a couple of officers showed up for an 
  inspection. We told them about the incursion the night before, but they did 
  not seem to know what to say about it. When we mentioned we doubled the guard 
  after the incident, they agreed that was a good idea. As they were getting 
  ready to leave, one of them asked for a drink of water. Crow went over to one 
  of the five five-gallon water cans that were now all lined up against our 
  building. He opened the lid and looked inside. He closed it fast and then did 
  the same to the other four. The water cans had a flip type of lid to 
  differentiate them from the screw down types used on gasoline cans. If a water 
  can was empty, it would move around a lot when it was opened. If it was full, 
  there was little movement. Watching Crow, we knew all but one of our cans were 
  either full or nearly so just by the lack of movement. He finally told the 
  officer we were out of water. The officer looked quite surprised, but he said 
  nothing. Crow had found wine in four cans, and the other one was empty.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">At this gun position, we lost Steve. Bob Armbruster had 
  taken a picture of him with Dillon and I just before he left (See Fig. 144). 
  He just walked off without saying goodbye to anyone and never came back. One 
  of the German rifles we had was missing. I had observed him field stripping it 
  the day before he left. We assumed he broke it down into smaller pieces in 
  order to make it easier to hide because it would not have been advisable for 
  him to be walking around Europe with a rifle showing. He was still wearing at 
  least part of his Polish army uniform and could have been mistaken for a 
  German soldier. We never knew where he went or what happened to him, but we 
  figured he was headed home. He was closer to his native Poland than when he 
  first joined us but he still had almost two hundred miles to go just to reach 
  the border. We worried about him because the Russian army now occupied most of 
  the areas he had to go through. Even when he arrived in his native country, if 
  he arrived, he would find it, too, was part of their territory. Also, the 
  Russian army had scorched the Polish towns when the German army pushed them 
  back to Moscow early in the war. The Germans had done the same thing when the 
  Russians counterattacked some years later. There could not be much left 
  standing in Poland to go back to. Steve’s troubles were a long way from being 
  over.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial">When we got word we were leaving Regensburg, we gave the 
  family who owned the apartment more 10-in-1 rations, but not before we took 
  out the goodies like cigarettes, candy, fruit cocktail, and date-nut bread. At 
  this point, I think they were wishing we would stay because the father just 
  kept smiling and gushing. Food was scarce, and there was no meat available. 
  The 10-in-1 rations were heavy on meat and vegetable products in cans. To us, 
  these rations were becoming more of a liability than an asset, because they 
  took up too much room in the truck and we just did not have the proper stove 
  or utensils to prepare the food they contained.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We emptied the sand bags over the wall (See Fig. 145) into the Danube River, 
  loaded up our trucks, hitched the guns up to them, and got ready to move. We 
  drove to a location outside of town and bivouacked overnight alongside the 
  road. The next day we traveled to the town of Landau on the Isar River, a 
  tributary to the Danube River. It would be our final gun position. We had gone 
  farther south toward Austria.<br>
