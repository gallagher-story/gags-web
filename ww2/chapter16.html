    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We traveled only about thirty miles from our
    previous gun site but we had entered another country. Our new gun position
    was in Differdange, Luxembourg, a suburb of Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg's
    second largest city, in the southwest corner of the small country. It was
    March 18th. We were situated in a large public park where we dug in and
    built up our gun pit with sand bags. The landscape was slightly hilly and we
    could see two of our battalion's gun emplacements some distance away. We had
    no idea what we were guarding, unless it was the town itself. There were no
    buildings nearby to billet in, so we set up our two six-man tents under some
    trees, away from the gun. We put our cots inside and called it home. The
    park setting created a tranquil feeling that felt good but not natural. A
    war zone did not feel like a war zone when we were surrounded by beautiful
    trees, expanses of green grass, and birds singing in the trees.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some high school girls came by the pit the
    first day we were there and they stopped to talk with us. It made our day,
    and reminded us we were in a friendly country. The girls spoke English well
    and wanted to practice their language skills on us. They told us what it was
    like during the German occupation. They referred to them as the Boche, which
    we found out later was a common term in other occupied countries as well. It
    had a derogatory overtone and the girls put an emphasis that showed great
    contempt on the word. Spearing said, "It sounds like they're spitting
    when they say that word, Boche"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Again, most of the time on duty at this gun
    position was spent scanning the sky looking for enemy planes. We were
    disappointed we were not seeing more action. Finally, around midnight on the
    second night, we heard a lone plane high overhead. Although we could not
    identify it because of the dark, we began tracking it. The engines were
    throwing out an afterglow that was easy to pick up. The word came over the
    phone that it was a German JU-88, a twin-engine medium bomber (See Fig. 86).
    We were told not to open fire on it but no reason was given. Because it was
    flying at such a high altitude, it appeared to be going slow. It was in view
    a long time, unlike the low-flying planes we saw in Woippy. The plane's
    engines had a very distinct sound unlike anything we had heard before. We
    could hear every stroke of its engines, and we thought it sounded like a
    couple of washing machines. It seemed to crawl across the sky, and we were
    unhappy we could not shoot at it. But why would a lone plane, especially
    such a slow-moving one, fly over enemy territory?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We found out the next morning. The Germans
    were dropping propaganda pamphlets, and a number of them had fallen near our
    gun position. They were little sheets of paper about four inches by six
    inches that showed, by a cartoon drawing, a girl at a bar with several men
    in civilian clothes hanging over her. The writing in English said something
    to the effect of, "Why are you fighting when your girlfriends and wives
    are home being fought over by civilians?" and "Did you know that
    only one out of every four men in the Army is ever in combat?" It was
    all done very crudely, and we just laughed at it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The next night at about the same time, the
    plane, or maybe it was another one of the same model, returned, flying
    basically the same route. We could identify it by the unusual beat of its
    engines. By this time, we had nicknamed it Midnight Charlie because of its
    arrival time. We were instructed by phone to fire this time but to wait for
    the searchlights to go on. There were several crews of a searchlight
    battalion in the park with us. The lenses on these lights appeared to be
    about eight feet in diameter and we were anxious to see them light up. When
    the plane was directly overhead, about a dozen of these lights went on,
    changing night into day up where the plane was. At the same time dozens of
    antiaircraft guns opened up with their red lines of tracers lighting the
    way. Our Battalion was firing 40mm and .50 calibers shells, and a 90mm unit
    was also firing. Even though it appeared there was a steady stream of
    tracers going up from the .50 caliber machine guns, we knew that only every
    fifth shell was a tracer. There were four more rounds between them that
    could not be seen. The expenditure of ammunition for one plane was enormous.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The shells from the 90s would explode at a
    preset altitude, leaving hundreds of large puffs of smoke dotting the sky
    like small clouds. The searchlights with their streams of white lights
    stabbing through the black night were shining off of them, making an
    unearthly sight. This, combined with the noise from the guns, smoke blowing
    from several directions, and the smell of gunpowder, combined to create an
    atmosphere of excitement. Then the hit came, and the object of all this
    attention, the ill-fated plane, turned into a ball of destruction. The plane
    split right in two. Debris flew in many directions, and one of the two main
    pieces fell straight down as the other half spiraled down. Some of the guns
    continued to fire at the pieces all the way to the ground. There were no
    parachutes. We almost felt sorry for the lone plane and its hapless crew. No
    one tried to take credit for the hit, because it was like shooting ducks in
    a rain barrel. The lights went off, and it was quiet and dark again. Our
    wish to see some action at this site had been answered, but, somehow, there
    was something missing with such an easy target.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The process of going from the intense action
    of shooting at a plane with all of the tracers in the sky, the noise from
    the guns, the searchlights and the adrenaline pumping, then, back to
    darkness with everything being quiet, all in a few minutes, was a very weird
    adjustment. We were all tense, and it took about an hour for us to relax
    again. It had been a stimulating experience with a certain amount of beauty
    involved if only for its unnaturalness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The next morning, we got to go into the town
    of Differdange for a shower, and this time we were issued some clean
    underwear. There were several large truck trailers set up by a quartermaster
    unit. We walked into one area that was divided by canvas partitions with
    about ten men in each partition where we were showered with warm water for
    about thirty seconds. Then we soaped up all over, followed by another
    thirty-second rinse. It was a condensed version of a real shower, but it did
    the job and was greatly appreciated. It was certainly a great improvement
    over what we had experienced in Nancy. We were not getting ourselves very
    clean by washing out of steel helmets at our gun positions because there was
    a limited amount of water that had to suffice for drinking, cooking and
    bathing. There was no set limit on how much we could use individually, but
    the crew had to share the five water cans of five gallons each we were
    issued about every other day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Early on March 21, we got March Order. We
    loaded up and headed off to join the convoy. As the trucks were assembling,
    Captain Mc Kee was darting up and down the convoy in his Jeep, doing his
    thing. His T-5 ranked driver and dog robber (a name given to an officer's
    flunky, always used as a pejorative), was making sharp U-turns, going from
    one place to another along the line of trucks as the Captain shouted to the
    drivers,: "Move up! Close the gap! Move ahead of the two trucks in
    front of you! Did you check your tires? Where's gun section number four? Did
    you see Lieutenant Harrison?" He was standing in the Jeep holding on to
    the top of the windshield and waving his swagger stick. Our leader was in
    his element directing his truck-borne troops into battle with all of the
    fervor and importance (to him only) of General Patton directing his tanks as
    they swept deeper into Germany. Actually, everyone knew the job could have
    been done by any noncom in the unit. But at least we saw him, although the
    only reason we looked was in the hopes of seeing someone else had taken his
    place as battery commander. While the rest of us felt what we did at our gun
    positions was of the greatest importance while in a combat zone, Mc Kee
    seemed to put his emphasis on more mundane things like counting trucks. He
    never once showed up at out gun pit for the full time we were in Europe-an
    oversight we greatly appreciated-but he was always making grand appearances
    during convoys. Mc Kee had all the characteristics of the psychotic ship
    captain described in the book The Cain Mutiny. All that was lacking were the
    steel balls clicking in his hand; but, never one to be outdone, he had the
    ever-present swagger stick to flag his pontifications.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Unbeknownst to us at the time, we were headed
    into an area that would be one of the most harrowing phases of our World War
    II adventure. The tranquil setting of the park we had just left did not help
    in the adjustment.</font></p>
