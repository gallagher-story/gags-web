    It Was Close</font></b>
</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After four months at Camp Haan, we packed up
    our gear, loaded our two-and-a-half ton trucks, attached the 40mm guns and
    M-51 mounts, and headed for the Mojave Desert to begin gunnery practice. On
    arrival, we thought we had made a wrong turn and wound up in the nearest
    thing to hell this earth had to offer.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had traveled in a convoy from Camp Haan to
    San Bernardino, then up through the Cajun Pass in the mountains. When we
    started the weather was ideal, and might have lulled us into the wrong view
    of what we were about to encounter. On the other side of the ridge, we came
    to the desert. The scenery until then was beautiful, with winding roads, an
    abundance of pine trees, and snow peaked mountains. Once we hit level ground
    again, the most desolate scenery I had ever seen surrounded us. We proceeded
    east to the town of Barstow, where we turned off the pavement onto a dirt
    road, the only road that lead to our destination. We passed a sign that
    said, Military Installation, No Trespassing. After driving about fifty miles
    through a cloud of dust kicked up by the trucks, we reached Camp (now Fort)
    Irwin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The temperature was over one-hundred-twenty
    degrees Fahrenheit. It had been hot riding in the truck, but when we jumped
    out into the glaring sunlight, it felt like we were entering a blast
    furnace. We all stood there a few minutes with nobody talking. It was as if
    we had landed on another planet, and nobody could find words to describe it
    or even to damn it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The surrounding ground was covered with
    nothing but sand, gravel, and patches of dried-up sagebrush, a rugged and
    harsh environment that appeared to be devoid of any living thing<br>
    (See Fig. 37b).<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Mohave Desert" src ="images/Mojave_Desert_6_37b.jpg" width=700 height=500 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There
    wasn't a sprig of green anywhere to be seen, not even a cactus. It was as
    though the searing sun had bleached all of the color out of the craggy
    landscape.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Mountains off in the distance rose out of the
    desert floor, but not even they could add any beauty to the desolute scene.
    They were not high enough to have snow on their peaks and there was nothing
    appealing about their appearance. Their dirty brown color made them
    resembled the Mesabi iron ore range in northern Minnesota I had seen in
    pictures. The only thing of any beauty in the landscape was the bright blue
    sky. The occasional small cirrus cloud offered no protection from the
    unrelenting sun.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I commented on the scenery to Bapst. "It
    looks like my first effort at landscape painting in the fourth grade."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"It must have been one lousy
    painting," he responded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The heat waves distorted everything as we
    looked off in the distance. It was unbelievably bleak and the heat was
    suffocating. Minutes after we unloaded from the trucks, Spearing-who hardly
    ever complained-sat down on the ground and held his head in his hands and
    said, "God, what a horrible place. What did we do to deserve
    this?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Other than the few GIs we had seen at the
    gate, there were no signs of human habitation. At first we thought we were
    the only outfit there, but we later learned there were other antiaircraft
    outfits encamped out of sight beyond some tents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first job was to unload all our
    equipment, set up our guns just outside the living area, and put everything
    in its proper place. The sergeants were prodding us to get to work, but
    everyone was so emotionally disgusted and physically drained, just walking
    around seemed to be all we could endure. How could anyone expect us to work
    in this heat? I felt like someone had opened a valve and drained all of the
    energy out of me. Some of us were just sitting on the sand or leaning
    against the trucks in the shade. Was this mutiny?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the staff sergeants came down the row
    of trucks shouting, "Come on, come on, get a move on, unload those
    trucks. Get off your asses - now!"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">He was not having a lot of success until he
    began yelling, "That's an order!" followed by the names of
    individuals. Then the fear of authority kicked in. Let's see, which Article
    of War threatened a court-martial if we did not obey a noncom's order? It
    didn't matter, because the last article took over if the others weren't
    applicable. The threat of dire consequences was the catalyst that got us
    moving as we grumbled and felt sorry for ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After unloading the equipment and setting up
    the gun in a gun park, we moved our personal gear to the tents where we
    would live. Each of us staked out our new home by taking over an Army cot.
    Camp Irwin proper was row after row of sand-colored six-man pyramidal tents
    with wooden floors (see Fig. 38a and 38b). Each tent had six cots with no mattresses
    and one potbelly stove. We each brought two blankets with us so we laid them
    on the cots to afford a little cushioning. The only permanent structures in
    camp were the PX, fire station, mess halls, and latrines.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Camp Irwin Pyramid Tents Mohave Desert" src ="images/Tents_Camp_Irwin_6_38a.jpg" width=500 height=371 ></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Jim Grimes and Bob Gallagher at Camp Irwin" src ="images/Tents_Camp_Irwin_6_38b.jpg" width=700 height=535 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After stowing our gear, we sat on our cots,
    elbows on our knees, discussing our feelings of dejection. We contemplated
    what life there was going to be like. The feelings were all negative. But
    this was our new home, and there was nothing we could do about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Before we could get too comfortable, we were
    called out into formation. We lined up outside the tents in the prescribed
    four straight lines and stood as the full blast of the sun's rays permeated
    our fatigue uniforms. I had never felt heat like that before. Several men in
    the formation swayed slightly as though they were going to keel over, but
    nobody fainted completely.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On my way out to the formation, I had bumped
    into Charlie Knoch from one of the other gun<img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Charlie Knoch" vspace="5" src="images/charlie_knoch_6_39.jpg" width="246" align="right" height="389">
    sections (See Fig. 39). He was one of the older soldiers in our outfit, and
    he was a good friend of mine. He had a stocky build and that soft look of
    someone who had spent most of his time as a civilian behind a desk. In fact,
    Charlie had a good job before entering service and was used to giving orders
    instead of receiving them. He often rode a fine line between keeping his
    mouth shut and telling an officer or a sergeant what he thought about him,
    or more specifically, about the order he had been given. The Army training
    had toughened him up a little, but he still looked more like an office
    manager than a seasoned soldier. Coming out of his tent that day on the
    desert, he looked like he was ready to explode. His cheeks were flushed from
    unloading the trucks and his eyes were glassy. He was a man of Irish
    heritage with minimal pigment in his skin. His nearly white complexion, with
    a heavy dose of freckles, could not tolerate even low doses of sunshine
    without getting severely sunburned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I had noticed how slowly Charlie moved into
    formation this first day. He shook his head from side to side when he saw me
    to indicate his disgust with the new surroundings. He was in the process of
    fashioning a nose guard from part of a package of cigarettes. It attached to
    his sunglasses, and, in addition to hiding his nose from the sun, would help
    hide the scowl on his face. I hoped none of the officers or cadre members
    would say anything to him in his present mood or there would be trouble. He
    probably realized this, too, because he took a position in the last row of
    the formation. I heard him mumbling several times when we were supposed to
    be listening, but it was quiet enough to not draw attention to him. When we
    were dismissed some time later, he and a lot of the rest of us headed to the
    latrine to splash water on our faces. It was the only place to get relief.
    Every time I saw Charlie while we were out in the desert, in addition to his
    home-made nose guard, he had zinc oxide smeared over his face, his neck, and
    the back of his hands. This helped some, but it was impossible to be
    completely protected. The desert with its glaring sunshine was unhealthy for
    all of us, but it was a real threat to guys like him. He really suffered
    while we were there. His overall dislike of the Army, now expanded by these
    unpleasant conditions on the Mojave Desert, was about to test his mental and
    physical resolve.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It took several days before we began to adapt
    to the extreme heat. However, adapt doesn't mean living there became any
    easier. The griping we did the first few days eased up a bit, but would
    start up again as the training got harder. We went about our duties as we
    were told even though everything requiring physical exertion seemed harder
    to do. The extremely hot weather and stark scenery were accepted as fact, a
    fact we could do nothing about. We soon began to settle into the same kind
    of routine we had Camp Haan. We would lie around on our bunks during free
    time, reminiscing about the advantages at Camp Haan. How our outlook had
    changed now that we were living in the desert! The place that had seemed so
    miserable just a short time ago was now looked on with fond memories.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Even 
      though we thought things could not possibly get any worse, we were a long 
      way from reaching the bottom rung of living conditions. From here on, it 
      would be all downhill.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In an 
      effort to keep our tent from collecting the heat of the sun, we kept the 
      side flaps rolled up at all times. At night, we rolled across our cots 
      until our bodies were at the outer edge of the tent, hoping to grab some 
      trace of a breeze. Usually, there was none. The brilliant stars and bright 
      moon on some evenings were our only compensation. We lay there in only our 
      shorts, thinking, tired from the day's work. It wasn't long before the 
      tent was filled with the echoes of six snoring men.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      daybreak and sometimes before, we awoke with our two wool GI blankets 
      pulled over us to ward off the morning chill, but as the bright orange sun 
      rose over the mountains, all signs of cool weather disappeared and the hot 
      blistering heat took over again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      ability to get a good night sleep in the cool night air was one of the few 
      good things about the desert. Another was the lack of flies or mosquitoes. 
      They were smart enough to stay away from that environment.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b 
      >Rifle Practice on the Range</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      wasn't much to look forward to in camp except the expectation of finally 
      firing our guns. This was an opportunity to participate in an adventure 
      previously foreign to most of us. We were especially anxious to fire the 
      M-1 rifles issued at Camp Haan. We cleaned them often, in preparing for 
      when the time came. After several weeks, we were taken to a rifle range to 
      qualify at gunnery practice. To avoid the midday sun, we got up at 0430 
      hours and ate our breakfast; we were on the range before sunup.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="M-1 Rifle Taking Aim" src="images/M1_Rifle_Bob_Gallagher_Aiming_6_40.jpg" width="500" height="384" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      could have slept another hour because we had to wait at least that long 
      before it was light enough to see the targets. We lay and sat around on 
      the sand in groups as we whiled away the time. One of the most frequently 
      quoted expressions in the Army was, "Hurry up and wait." We were always in 
      a hurry to get someplace, and then we would just stand or sit around 
      waiting for something to happen. This was a common occurrence in our 
      training. We always seemed to operate at one extreme or the other. Either 
      we were moving at full pace or at a dead stop.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      my turn to fire came up, I went to a prescribed spot on the firing line 
      where an experienced soldier from another outfit was ready to instruct me 
      (See Fig. 40). First, the leather sling attached to my rifle was loosened 
      up, and then wrapped tightly around my right arm to give the gun more 
      stability. The first rounds were fired from a sitting position, done in a 
      prescribed fashion with my elbows resting on my knees just so. I was shown 
      how to keep the rifle butt tight into my shoulder and told to hold my 
      breath at the moment of firing. It was not a natural position, and, at 
      first, it took some adjusting to get used to it. Finally, I was told how 
      to line up the rifle's rear sight with the one at its tip and where the 
      target bull's-eye should fit in relation to them. It seemed to take longer 
      to get everyone set up to fire than did the actual firing. After taking so 
      long, someone commented, "I hope if we ever get up against the Japs, they 
      give us a lot of time to get ready." I wondered why we were using the 
      leather sling. Certainly, it would not be used in any kind of combat 
      condition. Finally, I was given a clip of ammunition that I loaded into 
      the gun without putting a round into the firing chamber.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">About 
      fifty of us were lined up in a row, and an officer checked to make sure 
      nobody was between the firing line and targets. If anyone moved the gun 
      even slightly while facing the target, someone immediately chewed him out. 
      The lieutenant then shouted, "Load the chamber and release the safety 
      clasps! Ready on the right, ready on the left, ready on the firing 
      line-commence firing!" and we would fire a clip full (eight rounds) of 
      ammunition at the targets, taking careful aim after each shot. The officer 
      then yelled, "Cease firing and set safety clasps!" and we would all reload 
      our rifles. We fired from the sitting, standing, and prone positions at 
      targets two-hundred-fifty and five hundred feet away. Under the heavy 
      smell of gunpowder and with our ears still ringing, we watched our scores 
      being tabulated. I qualified as a marksman the first time. That was better 
      than some who did not qualify at all, but it was not as good as others. 
      There were two classes better than marksman: sharpshooter and expert, with 
      expert being the best. Several days later, while some of the men were 
      trying to qualify for the first time, I shot again and made expert that 
      time. I also qualified with a carbine rifle and a Thompson submachine gun 
      some weeks later.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As 
      part of our time out on the firing range, we took a turn working the 
      targets while other soldiers were qualifying. We went out to the targets 
      and down into a trench below where we were protected by an earthen berm 
      from the firing. The targets were set up on a pulley system whereby we 
      could raise them for firing, then lower them after to check for holes. We 
      used a four-inch diameter black disc attached to a long stick to show the 
      scorer where the bullet holes were located. If a shot missed the target 
      entirely, we waved the disc back and forth across the target several 
      times. This was known as waving Maggie's drawers.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Despite an effort by one of the sergeants in the pit 
      to keep the scores legitimate, some cheating went on while I was there. It 
      wasn't an effort to help any individual because we did not know who was 
      firing at our target, but some men took the scoring job as an opportunity 
      to create devilment. "He missed the damned target three out of eight 
      times-a real Sergeant York," the guy next to me whispered referring to the 
      World War I hero who was known for his accurate shooting, as he was 
      marking bulls-eyes and near bulls-eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      the shooting practice and target duty were over we headed back to our tent 
      area. Although we had not done a lot of physical exertion that day, we 
      were all dead tired when it was over. The simplest routine in the intense 
      heat was enough to wear out even the most fit. Back at camp, we 
      disassembled out rifles, cleaned the metal parts with gasoline, and 
      lightly oiled them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      did basically the same kind of duty at Camp Irwin we did at Camp Haan, but 
      now everything seemed to be done in slow motion. Everything was done under 
      the full rays of the sun. There were no structures to shade a large group 
      of people. Whatever we were doing, the sun was our constant companion. 
      While we were all in great physical condition from our months of basic 
      training, we did not have the same strength or endurance we did before 
      coming to the desert. We were all running at something less than full 
      speed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">To 
      protect ourselves from sunburn, we had to take drastic measures. We stayed 
      completely covered up when the sun was at its highest. Soon, we all made 
      makeshift nose guards out of cardboard like Charlie Knock had on the first 
      day. Many men still had problems with sunburn. Some went to the hospital 
      but they usually wound up with nothing but a tube of zinc oxide, the only 
      medicine available. We all wore sunglasses, lip balm and fatigue hats with 
      a brim. A few individuals with swarthy skin went from dark complexions to 
      darker. They were the only ones who went around without shirts during 
      their off hours. The rest of us stayed covered from head to toe whenever 
      we were outside and nursed our sunburned necks, faces and 
hands.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      wore blue fatigues the sun bleached several shades lighter. They had metal 
      buttons that got so hot and they would burn our bare skin if we touched 
      them. We finally found a method we thought would give us some relief 
      during the worst time of the day, around noon. After lunch-or dinner as 
      the Army called it-a lot of us would go into the shower room of the 
      latrine and stand under the spigots with our clothes on to let the water 
      cool us off. Then we would come out and stand in formation to start the 
      afternoon activities without drying ourselves. It was a strange sight 
      seeing a line of soldiers with steam rising from them. We would be 
      completely dry in an hour or so. Finally they made us stop the midday 
      showers, saying it did not look military, whatever that meant.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      a few weeks in the desert, morale began to drop, and soon it was about as 
      low as it could be. The griping picked up again, and we tried everything 
      we could to get out of work. We heard temperatures would reach more than 
      one hundred twenty degrees, but we never knew how official those were. 
      There was a complete shortage of thermometers at this camp, which was 
      probably not an oversight. What we did know for sure was it was hotter 
      than any of us had ever experienced.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 
      our spare time there was nothing to do, so we did a lot of horsing around. 
      Some of it led to <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Gillenwater" vspace="5" src="images/Gillenwater_6_41a.jpg" width="250" align="left" height="312" >some 
      not-so-friendly fighting. I had several bouts with a fellow named 
      Gilllenwater (See Fig. 41a) from another gun section. He had a certain 
      swagger about him, but he was also very likable. We played on the same 
      baseball team back at Camp Haan, and I considered him a friend if not a 
      real pal. The adulation he had received in high school as a star football 
      player had evidently gone to his head, and he frequently bragged about his 
      athletic exploits. This wore quite thin with those who lived with him in 
      the same tent but to the rest of us who saw him less frequently, it was 
      just blowing so much wind. Although he was considerably shorter than me, 
      we weighed about the same.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      first fight started with an exchange of words, then escalated into a real 
      donnybrook. I was passing his tent on my way back to my tent from the 
      latrine. He was standing in front with a couple of his buddies.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Hey, 
      Gallagher, you look like a big ugly orangutan," he spouted as he reached 
      out and gave me a hard punch on the arm. He was smiling from ear to 
      ear.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"At 
      least I'm not a sawed-off has-been of a football player, and keep your 
      hands to yourself," I responded.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >"What's the matter? You can't take a little punch? I 
      thought the Army made a man out of you."<br>I 
      continued walking as he followed me to my tent throwing verbal barbs from 
      behind. I entered my tent and when he followed me inside, I knew he was 
      out to provoke a fight.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Come 
      on Gallagher, let's see how tough you guys from Chicago really are. What's 
      a big guy like you afraid or something?" I knew that my size was playing a 
      factor in this confrontation. A competitive guy like him would enjoy 
      showing that, despite his shorter stature, he could either back off a much 
      taller guy like me or, better yet, defeat me in a fight. Also, he had come 
      from a small town in western Illinois and his perception of large cities 
      like Chicago was somewhat warped. I had heard him describe the big city as 
      if there were gunmen roaming every street and crime running rampant. He 
      had seen too many Hollywood movies with Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. 
      Robinson playing gangsters. I had not told him the only guns I had seen 
      before entering service were strapped to the waists of 
      policemen.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      I turned around to face him, he was still smiling like he was just playing 
      around, but his actions told me he was quite serious. When he cocked his 
      arm to throw another punch, I figured he had laid down the gauntlet and 
      there was no other course open to me but to get an edge on him. Before he 
      could jab me, I reached out and grabbed his head in an arm-lock and we 
      spun down to the wooden floor.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      wrestling match lasted about twenty minutes as we bounced off cots and the 
      floor. There were long, agonizing minutes when we lay there locked in some 
      kind of hold with neither one being able to move until one of us wrenched 
      loose. Then it was more grabbing, twisting, tripping and locking up again. 
      We spun around the tent again and again. I heard the snap of a wooden cot 
      frame as we hit it on our way to the floor. Someone in the audience let 
      out a whooping "whoa!" The stove was knocked over and the pipe leading out 
      the top of the tent came down in pieces. Bedding, clothing, and equipment 
      were scattered all over the place, and some of it was knocked out of the 
      tent altogether. It was a heated battle! The men in the tent when we 
      started moved outside to join the crowd that congregated. Bets were being 
      taken who was going to be the winner. When we were through, the tent was 
      in shambles. We had broken three wooden cot frames. Later, we would have 
      to feed them into the supply room one at a time for replacements without 
      the supply sergeant getting wise to what happened.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      fight was the result of our boredom and the effort to do something besides 
      lying around doing nothing. I felt I had won the fight only because I 
      wound up pinning him down at the end. But I did not feel like a winner. I 
      was black and blue all over, as I am sure he was, too. My whole body ached 
      for days. Later I realized it might have been better if I had lost the 
      fight. Gillenwater was one of those super competitive guys who could not 
      stand to lose anything he was competing in. For weeks he continued to 
      provoke me with jabs to the arm and other physical contact. We wound up in 
      another fight. That one was not as severe as the first one, but I was 
      getting pretty sick of this guy. I did not know how to get rid of him 
      without completely subjugating myself to him. My pride would not allow 
      that to happen. I had learned from the first fight he was not as tough as 
      he thought he was. Things improved when he came down with an infection to 
      his neck. It was the worst case of boils I had ever seen; he was laid up 
      in bed for several days. He lost about twenty pounds over a couple of 
      weeks while battling the infection and was quite weak from its effects. I 
      knew he was not in fighting shape when men started to make fun of his 
      condition without him responding. "Hey Gillenwater, that's the worst case 
      of clap I ever saw," was a typical dig thrown at him. When he recovered, 
      he seemed to lose some of his competitive nature and we went back to being 
      friends.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      had duties six days a week. Sunday was supposed to be a rest day but, even 
      then, one of the sergeants would often come around looking for men to do 
      some kind of a work detail. This led to most of us vacating our tent area 
      for most of the day. Despite the fact there weren't many places to hide, 
      we managed to find one. Several of my buddies and I would grab pocket 
      novels and head over to the firehouse. We would lie in the shade of the 
      building on the concrete ramp leading to the door and spend the time 
      talking and reading. It was a few degrees cooler there because the 
      concrete held some of the coolness from the night before. It was just one 
      of the drastic measures we used to get out of work, and the minor relief 
      from the heat was a bonus.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Not 
      too far from our camp were some small army tanks that we took some time 
      investigating and playing around with (See Figs. 41b and 41c). They were 
      known as the M3 and M 4 models. Originally used in the Philippine Islands 
      and other locations early in the war they were found to be too slow, 
      lightly armored and low in firepower. Their cannon was a mere 37mm and 
      certainly would be no match for the German Panzer units that were 
      considerably bigger in all categories. Obviously, these tanks were being 
      stowed in the desert as unsuitable armored vehicles.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      on the desert, we took goldbricking to a new level. Men like myself who 
      normally wanted to be good soldiers and played everything by the book were 
      now taking evasive action at every opportunity to avoid work. We now made 
      a game of trying to look busy when needed and to do just enough to avoid 
      being chastised when observed. The desert heat brought out the worst in 
      us: military efficiency wasn't a consideration. Since we could not do 
      anything about the environment, the only way to compensate was to avoid 
      physical activity at all cost.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      we were finally eligible for passes, we took the opportunity to get away 
      from special assignments dealt out on weekends. The only place we could 
      get to was the town of Barstow and we did not expect too much from it. On 
      our trip from Camp Haan to Camp Irwin, we had passed through it and seen 
      it had little to offer for amusement. It proved worse than anticipated.<br 
      >I was with Le Claire and Grimes when we set off on 
      our first pass into town. We bounced the full fifty miles on a dusty road, 
      sitting on the wooden benches folded down from the two sides of the Army 
      deuce-and-a-half. There was a convoy of trucks and unless you were in the 
      first one, which we weren't, you ate the dust swirled up by those in front 
      the whole trip. When we got there, we were covered with a film of dirt 
      rendering the shower taken before leaving a waste of time.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Barstow's downtown area (See Fig. 41d) consisted of 
      one hotel, half a dozen taverns, a few little grocery stores, a post 
      office and some uninteresting shops. There were ten GIs for every 
      civilian, and it was just as hot there as in camp. We were on the lookout 
      for girls our age whenever we were away from camp, but there were none to 
      be seen in this place. It was a small desert town that could not absorb 
      the influx of thousands of service men looking for something to do to get 
      their minds off the daily grind of Army life.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Barstow, California" src="images/Barstow_California_6_41d.jpg" width="700" height="503" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      walked into a storefront building with a garish neon sign in the window 
      that said Bar with palm trees surrounding it. Who are they kidding with 
      those palm trees? I thought. There isn't a palm tree anywhere to be seen. 
      Inside the place was done up in western style. It could be called either 
      quaint or just plain dilapidated, depending upon one's perspective. 
      However, the one word that would best describe the place, dingy, could not 
      be contested. The foul smell of smoke and stale liquor, accentuated by the 
      hot stagnant air, was overpowering until you finally adjusted to it. The 
      walls were covered with some of the mangiest stuffed animal heads I had 
      ever seen. There were bears, buffalo, deer, rams, wolves, and some 
      unfamiliar animals. Most of them had been hanging there so long they had 
      picked up a heavy coating of dust, and the color of their skins had all 
      taken on the same dull gray look. The walls hadn't been painted in 
      decades, the floor was rough planking, and antique light fixtures hung 
      from the ceiling. A couple fans oscillated slowly between the light 
      fixtures but they did not move the air. Whatever the temperature was 
      outside, it was at least another ten degrees higher inside. The bar was 
      ornate, and the mirrored wall behind it was irregularly worn from age and 
      heavily cracked. With just a little bit of imagination, one could envision 
      some really violent bar fights had occurred in this joint over the years. 
      We walked up to the bar and Grimes addressed the portly, sullen looking 
      Mexican bartender, who was wearing a well-worn snakeskin cowboy hat 
      adorned with pheasant feathers, snakeskin boots, a dirty blue shirt, and 
      an even dirtier white apron across his pants.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Give 
      us three beers," Grimes requested.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"No 
      beer, just tequila," responded the bartender as he wiped the bar in front 
      of him. His large bushy and tobacco-stained mustache completely hid his 
      mouth, giving him a walrus like look. He picked up the badly worn tin 
      ashtray covered with chewing-tobacco advertisements. He wiped under it 
      with new vigor. Despite the fact it was nearly overflowing with cigarette 
      butts, he made no effort to empty it. The bar at this location did not 
      need to be wiped but it gave him an excuse not to look at us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >"Tequila!" Le Claire and I chimed in. I knew that it 
      was a Mexican drink but other than that, I had never been exposed to it. 
      The only description I had ever heard about it was that it was rotgut.<br 
      >"How about whiskey?" Grimes asked.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"No 
      whiskey, just tequila," he responded, still wiping the invisible spot on 
      the bar.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Do 
      you have Coke?" Grimes persisted, partly because he felt he was now in a 
      contest of wills.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"No 
      beer, no whiskey, no coke, just tequila." the man retorted in disgust. 
      Then he picked up his bar rag, continued to avoid our stares, and turned 
      away from us realizing this was a no-sale. He knew we did not even know 
      what tequila was. Looking down the bar we saw several Mexicans and half a 
      dozen GIs. The Mexicans were obviously drunk, and the GIs were well on 
      their way as they talked in near shouts to people standing right next to 
      them. Everyone was standing and leaning on the bar; there were no stools. 
      There was nothing but shot glasses in front of them with no sign of a 
      wash. This was real man drinking going on and the patrons seemed 
      particularly proud to be participating in it. Two GIs standing nearest to 
      us were snickering in obvious delight listening to us amateurs in our 
      conversation with the bartender. Farther down the bar there was one woman 
      we had not seen among the soldiers when we first entered the saloon. She 
      continued to be well hidden until we left. One GI was draped over her like 
      a blanket. He was protecting a rare commodity in Barstow, a 
      woman.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      left there and proceeded down the street to another bar. "You know why 
      they didn't have bar stools in that place, don't you?" I asked my buddies. 
      Before they could answer, I gave them my answer. "It eliminates one thing 
      that can be thrown in a fight after your brain gets fried from tequila." I 
      also commented, "I wouldn't be surprised to see Sergeant Montelone and his 
      cadre members back there in that joint. It had all of the class that they 
      do."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      second bar was packed with GIs to the point where we had to push our way 
      to an open area. There was no waitress, which wasn't a surprise. First, 
      there wasn't enough room for one to move around in, and second, what woman 
      would want to squeeze herself through a hundred or so sex-starved, 
      partially inebriated soldiers? It took us some time to get three bottles 
      of Lucky Lager beer passed from the bar through many hands with the money 
      going the opposite way. Just as at our first stop, there was no mention of 
      furnishing proof of age so our fake ID cards remained in our pockets. We 
      stood in a corner of the place and drank out of the bottle. It was ice 
      cold and tasted great. Then we knew why the place was so crowded. What the 
      three of us called hillbilly music was blaring from a jukebox across the 
      room. The place was so noisy it was difficult to hear each other talk. 
      There were pictures on the wall, including the one found in all low-grade 
      saloons of dogs playing cards. The large room was filled with a thick 
      cloud of cigarette smoke, but nobody complained or even seemed to notice. 
      That's the way all bars were. The fans here did nothing but blow the smoke 
      back down on the customers. The hot air, smoke, and strong beer smell 
      mixture along with the crowded conditions finally became suffocating. We 
      tried to move outside with our beers but as we hit the sidewalk, the town 
      sheriff told us liquor was not allowed on the street. He was dressed in 
      cowboy gear, and sticking out of his holster was a large pistol Grimes 
      described as being "just one step down from being classified as a cannon." 
      However, his manner was friendly when he said "Now you boys just take that 
      beer back into the bar, ya hea?" I wanted to mimic the twang in his voice, 
      but he looked like a no-nonsense kind of guy and I decided that prudence 
      was a safer way to go. We pushed back inside and finished off the beers 
      before leaving the tavern.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Le 
      Claire, who had a sarcastic wit, asked, "Having a good time?" Neither 
      Grimes nor I responded. We saw no humor in his remark.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Without knowing exactly what we were looking for, we 
      proceeded to hunt for that mythical goal of a good time. We walked along 
      the main street of town hoping to find something interesting. However, the 
      barber shop, shoe repair shop, delicatessen, more crowded taverns, and the 
      other small businesses along the way looked like any other little town in 
      America.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">What 
      was it we were looking for? What in the hell were we doing 
here?</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      would have been nice to meet some young girls we could talk to or flirt 
      with. But if there were any available in Barstow, they were doing a good 
      job of hiding. We were part of the giant mass of pathetic GIs desperately 
      looking for a good time and finding nothing but boredom in small-town 
      America. I, for one, could hardly wait to get out of there, but the first 
      trucks back to camp were not leaving for several hours. We went back to 
      the bar, had several more beers, returned to the trucks, and loaded up. We 
      wanted to be sure we would be among the first to leave. There was no good 
      time to be had in Barstow unless you were interesting in getting drunk at 
      a faster rate than the 3-2 beer at the camp's PX could furnish. What we 
      really wanted to do was go to Hollywood, but it was too far and difficult 
      to get to. The memories of hundreds of beautiful sun-tanned girls lined up 
      on the edge of the dance floor at the Palladium Ballroom just waiting to 
      be asked to dance were like an unreachable oasis in our minds.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      loading up, one of the men from our outfit who heard me complaining to Le 
      Clare about Barstow asked me, "Did you visit the U.S.O. 
      canteen?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"What 
      canteen?" I replied. "I never saw one. How could I have missed it?" We 
      always kept an eye out for canteens in any town we visited because it 
      usually meant free food.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"It 
      was in the basement of the school. But, don't worry, you didn't miss 
      anything - no dames," he answered.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On 
      the way back to camp, several men got sick from the drinking. They spent 
      most of the trip with their heads over the truck's tail gate 
      regurgitating. Le Claire commented, "There goes the tequila, and it hasn't 
      even changed color." We were jostled around on the rough road and felt 
      every bump because of the truck's hard springs. The effect on the kidneys 
      sent many men to the rear to relieve themselves. We got another taste of 
      dust, and there was little conversation. Grimes was lying on the floor 
      sleeping soundly. Only he could slumber on a bed of steel slats and hard 
      wood while being bounced about. We often kidded him about being able to 
      sleep on a picket fence; the bed of a two-and-a-half ton truck was only a 
      small step more comfortable than that. The ride back to camp was a fitting 
      finale to a wasted trip.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Back 
      at Camp Irwin, the PX and outdoor theater were both crowded in the 
      off-duty hours, with long lines at both. Neither was air-conditioned. 
      However, we learned to appreciate them as a divergence from the tent area. 
      The theater always had two long lines, one to buy tickets and the other to 
      get in. We took turns purchasing the tickets for a bunch of us, which 
      eliminated waiting in one line.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Italian prisoners of war were held at this camp just 
      like at Camp Haan. We would see them occasionally as they performed their 
      work details. A rumor was going around they were allowed to go into 
      Barstow on Thursday evenings to visit the bars. This was the kind of rumor 
      that fed on itself, and soon the GIs were grumbling the prisoners were 
      being treated better than the soldiers were. Nobody in authority ever 
      confirmed or denied the rumor, and it finally died out. Some of us felt if 
      visiting Barstow was being offered the prisoners, it was more like cruel 
      and unusual punishment than a reward.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      Army's Special Services put on one show with live entertainers while we 
      were in Camp Irwin, and it proved to be a real embarrassment for me. It 
      was held outdoors on a Friday night, so thousands of us sat on the sand 
      and faced a makeshift stage set up for the occasion. When the actors came 
      out on the stage at the beginning of the skit, we found out it was an all 
      male cast. The lack of girls was a huge disappointment to us all because 
      most of us had come just to see one. "Where are the girls?" and "We came 
      here for this?" were some of the comments being hollered at the cast, 
      along with a heavy dose of boos. The actors looked quite nervous. One of 
      them tried to joke about the lack of females, but this only produced more 
      boos. As the cast stood there, I recognized one of them as a guy named Ed 
      Weiss who had been in several classes with me in high school. I made a big 
      thing about knowing him to the friends I was with and to others seated 
      near me. I made plans to go backstage and talk to him after the 
      presentation. When the play started, Ed played the part of a fop with all 
      kinds of feminine moves, and he wasn't good at it, either. In fact, the 
      play was so bad they had trouble finishing it with the entire audience 
      ridiculing it continually.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"So 
      that's your buddy, is it Gallagher?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"You 
      must have gone to some high school."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Did 
      you two go to prom together?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"Be 
      careful when you go see him, he might kiss you."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
      felt like crawling on my hands and knees to get away. I never went to see 
      Ed, and it took weeks before the ribbing died down.</font></p>

      >A Move To Pup Tent Living</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      about a month in camp, our battalion loaded up everything and moved to a 
      valley about ten miles away where we set up a battalion camp. It was known 
      as the East Range. Other than our battalion with its equipment, there was 
      not a human being or man-made structure in sight. We pitched our two-man 
      pup tents in straight rows on the sun-baked sand for an extended stay (See 
      Figs. 42a and 42b).<br></font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Pup Tent City Mojave Desert" src="images/Pup_Tent_City_6_42.jpg" width="600" height="350" ></p>

      <p><img border="0" src="images/Pup_Tents_Mojave_Desert_6_42b.jpg" width="600" height="468" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Each 
      soldier had a canvas piece, called a shelter-half, four tent pins, and one 
      pole as part of his gear. We each picked a buddy and put our 
      shelter-halves together to make a complete tent. The finished product was 
      triangular, about three-feet high, and six-feet wide at the bottom. It was 
      held down with the wooden stakes, and one end could be buttoned closed. 
      The other end was open. The floor area was just barely wide enough for two 
      bedrolls, and we also squeeze in our duffel bags plus all our other 
      equipment at the closed end. We could not even sit up in the tent because 
      of the sloping roof. Because I was tall, my head stuck out the open end 
      about six inches when lying down but, fortunately, it never rained while 
      we were in the desert. Joe Bernal was my tent mate. Joe was from the Back 
      of the Yards-the stockyards area-neighborhood in Chicago and was quick to 
      inform me that he lived upwind of the yards. We were the same age and had 
      a lot in common.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      continued to wear uniform fatigues but switched from fatigue caps to 
      helmet liners on some days. The liners gave less protection from the sun 
      than fatigue hats and sunburned faces became a greater problem.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Other 
      items we wore every day were the gas mask (or the "goddam gas mask" as we 
      referred to it) and a cartridge belt. The belt had pockets to carry clips 
      of ammunition for our M-1 rifles, which were empty at this camp. It also 
      had holes reinforced with metal around the bottom edge where a canteen, 
      first aid kit, and bayonet scabbard could be fastened, with room for other 
      items. In the desert, only the canteen was hanging from the belt while the 
      gas mask strap was slung over our left shoulder and the mask hung by our 
      side.</font></p>

      >Gunnery Practice</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      several weeks of living in this pup tent city in the middle of nowhere, it 
      was difficult to put up with the boredom. We were told we were there to 
      take target practice with our 40mm and .50 caliber machine guns, but they 
      took a long time getting around to it. We were out in the sun from sun up 
      to sun down. The only shade available came from the pup tents, and they 
      did not offer a lot of relief-the air inside them being hotter than the 
      outside. Also, the shade they offered was not usually available to us 
      because our duties kept us away from them most of the day. There were no 
      passes given while we were there, and we were not even allowed to go into 
      Camp Irwin to the PX or theater. Our whole life was centered on that 
      auxiliary camp. Calisthenics were done early in the morning to avoid the 
      midday heat; we played no sports because it took too much physical 
      exertion. There was little to read, we had no radios, and they had a 
      difficult time trying to find things to keep us busy. We repeated the same 
      tasks of maintaining the 40mm gun (See Fig. 43), learning about our 
      equipment, and studying aircraft identification (See Fig. 44) over and 
      over again until we became sick of the repetitive routine.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      was a large black tent set up as the kitchen. We stood in long lines at 
      our D-Battery kitchen and the food was shoveled into our aluminum mess 
      kits. The food was terrible because Sergeant Emerling was not visible in 
      the kitchen tent. Rumor had it that he was AWOL again. The menu varied, 
      but we could be sure that the dessert for dinner would be fruit cocktail 
      almost every day. It soon went from being a real treat to something most 
      men refused to take. We would sit around on the sand near the kitchen to 
      eat, then stand in more long lines to wash our mess kits and utensils. The 
      wash consisted of three metal garbage cans: one for the garbage, the 
      second for washing and the third for rinsing.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      in line to be served, there was always someone being goosed. This was one 
      of those obnoxious habits that always seemed to feed upon itself whenever 
      the men were bored. By this time in our training, the men who reacted the 
      most vehemently had been selected for the most abuse. Some would wrench 
      violently, and these men were usually targeted when they had their hands 
      full with their mess kit and cup. They would throw their hands up in the 
      air as the food and drink went sailing. Today it would properly be called 
      abuse, but at the time, everyone except the victim thought it was a big 
      joke. The ranking noncoms made no effort to control it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Sergeant Montelone kept us ever on edge with his 
      foul-mouthed commands. He reached a new low while at this camp. One day 
      while we were in formation he announced, "A new man is being transferred 
      into our outfit, and he's a Jew." He then told us not to talk to him when 
      he arrived. Was there no down limit to this guy's depraved mind we 
      thought? None of us had given it any serious thought, but the few Jewish 
      men we knew about were in Headquarters Battery. It never really meant 
      anything to the rest of us what nationality or religion anyone 
      was.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      next day the new recruit arrived right after we had finished supper. We 
      were all lying around on the sand near our pup tents, taking it easy. 
      Taking it easy, that is, because there was nothing else to do or anyplace 
      else to go. The new man checked in, then walked down between two of the 
      long lines of tents. Nobody talked to him, and it was obvious he was aware 
      he was being shunned. At the end of one line, he dropped his gear and got 
      out his tent equipment. He was trying to devise some method of making a 
      shelter but there was no way you could rig a tent out of one shelter-half. 
      Joe and I were in the last tent across from where he was, and we started 
      to talk to him. We learned his name was Melvin Felvarge, and he was about 
      our age. We asked him if he wanted to share our tent, and he said yes. 
      With his piece of canvas, we rigged it so our tent could sleep three. We 
      found him to be a very nice guy, and we made a lasting friend. Joe and I 
      had used up most of our conversation during the many evenings together so 
      Mel rewarded us with some new subjects. We knew that Monteleone would be 
      furious, but we wondered, how could that SOB be any more obnoxious than he 
      already was? The next day, he did make some comments to me, but the whole 
      incident soon blew over. Melvin was assigned to another gun section, he 
      got another tent mate, and he stayed with our outfit for the rest of the 
      war.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With 
      the extremely high temperatures, water was a problem. We drank a lot, and 
      because there was no ice or refrigeration, what we were given was very 
      warm; maybe you could call it hot. The aluminum canteen was carried in a 
      cloth cover attached to our gun belt but we seldom used it. Each of us 
      also carried a water bag we had bought at the PX. It was about fifteen 
      inches wide and twenty-four inches high, made out of a canvas material 
      with a rope handle for carrying over the shoulder. The water sweating 
      through the canvas would evaporate which lowered the temperature of the 
      water inside the bag about fifteen degrees. Water at one-hundred and five 
      degrees is better than one-hundred and twenty degrees, but not much 
      better. We filled the bags from a large rubber Lister bag held up by a 
      tripod that sat out in the sun all day near the kitchen tent. The secret 
      was to get there before the cooks loaded the bag up with chlorine 
      purification tablets. The hot water was bad enough, but the addition of a 
      strong chlorine taste made it even worse.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some 
      men tried to reduce their water intake. They wanted to be able to go 
      without water if we were sent to the desert in North Africa (actually, the 
      Axis Armies had been driven out of North Africa by May of 19431 but most 
      of us didn't know that) or the tropics of the South Pacific. I thought 
      that this was a very dumb idea. I figured I would worry about going 
      without when the time came and not before.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Finally, we were told we were ready for target 
      practice with our 40mm guns. All the battalion gun sections dug pits in a 
      row (See Fig.45) just outside our pup tent camp area. In keeping with Army 
      tradition, we did nothing but sit around and wait for several days (See 
      Fig. 46a and 46b). Then we were given live ammunition, loaded up the guns 
      and were ready to fire (See Fig. 47a). Our gun was manned by Spearing in 
      one tracking seat handling the crank that moved the gun horizontally (or 
      azimuth as they called it). Bapst operated the crank that moved the gun 
      vertically. Wellington stood on the platform, cocked the gun to put a 
      round into the firing chamber, and loaded six-shell clips into a slot as 
      needed. He fired the gun by stepping on a pedal on the platform floor. 
      While firing at two rounds per second, he had only three seconds to get 
      the next clip in before the gun ran out of ammunition (See Fig. 46). 
      Stevens and Thomas stood on the floor of the gun pit and handed clips of 
      ammunition to Wellington. My job as gunner was to stand behind the gun on 
      the pit floor and direct the fire. I also had to hold a rope tied to 
      Wellington's leg so that I could pull his foot off the firing pedal in an 
      emergency. Once all the guns were ready, a plane flew down the lineup at 
      an elevation of about 3,000 feet pulling a white cloth sleeve about three 
      feet in diameter and twenty feet long attached to the plane with a long 
      steel cable. The plane was piloted by women from a quasi-service branch of 
      the Army Air Force called the Women's Air Force Service or WAFS, for 
      short. Each of the four letter batteries (A, B, C, and D) with their eight 
      guns each would take turns firing at the sleeve. Each battery had the tips 
      of their shells dipped in different color paint so the projectiles that 
      hit the sleeve would leave some color for identification. The firing was 
      an exciting time with the crews moving in precision as they had been 
      trained. The roar of the guns, the smell of gunpowder, and the overall 
      action was a great thrill. To a bunch of young men, this was the ultimate 
      fun.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      the shooting ceased, the target was dropped and then examined so the 
      number of holes of each color could be counted to determine each battery's 
      score. The battery with the greatest number of hits would then have 
      bragging rights as being the best shots.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      least, that's the way it was supposed to work.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As we 
      continued having target practice on a daily basis, the scores seemed quite 
      high, although we had no way to prove otherwise. Then, one day the tow 
      plane dropped the target near our gun and we ran out to retrieve it. We 
      counted five hits for the whole battalion. That did not agree with 
      previous scores and it certainly wasn't many for the thirty-two guns doing 
      the firing. Although we had only a quick look, we could detect paint only 
      on one hole. About the last three feet of the sleeve was badly shredded 
      from the wind and possibly a hit. A Jeep from Headquarters Battery showed 
      up and the second lieutenant aboard took the target away to be evaluated. 
      That evening we got the official score - twenty-eight hits. We wondered 
      what was going on. We could have missed a few holes, but no matter how you 
      counted, there wasn't anywhere near that many in the target we saw. We 
      asked around for an answer but the only response we got was, "They made an 
      adjustment for the part of the target that was missing." Obviously, 
      someone was lying, but at that time we did not realize the significance of 
      the padded scores. It would later prove of great importance in keeping our 
      battalion together as an antiaircraft unit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 
      addition to the target practice, where we used the hand cranks on the gun, 
      we tried our skill with the trackers operating the director (See Fig. 47b 
      and 47c). They would stand in a separate pit and look through scopes 
      mounted on each side of the director as they tracked the plane by moving 
      small cranks to keep the cross hairs on it. This method was touted as 
      being more accurate than visual sighting. We did not feel this was true, 
      but it was impossible to have an accurate comparison when the scores were 
      being manipulated.<br></font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="40mm Gun and Director" src="images/40mm_gun_director_6_47b.jpg" width="550" height="435" ></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Director_with_Azimuth_6_47c.jpg" width="441" height="665" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      director was serviced by a technician who had the rating of T-3-a staff 
      sergeant with a "T" in the middle of his chevrons. He had been trained in 
      the workings of this instrument. His job was the most envied in our 
      battery because we considered it to be the easiest, and he had a high rank 
      on top of it. All through our training we had watched him, as he seemed to 
      be excluded from any type of duty even remotely resembled work. His 
      uniform was always spotless, and he walked around with an arrogant air 
      that riled some and made others jealous. When the director was not 
      operating properly, we would send for the technician. First, he would 
      berate us for doing something wrong even though he had no basis for doing 
      so. Then, he would remove half a dozen screws on a steel panel located on 
      the side of the director with all the concentration a doctor uses in 
      surgery, look in with a flashlight, rotate the control wheels a couple of 
      times, then declare "It has to go to ordinance." As far as we knew, he had 
      never done anything more than add oil to a couple squeaking joints. Grimes 
      and Le Claire kidded him once about his cushy job, and he got quite upset 
      about it. Evidently, he felt he was performing a valuable 
      service.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Great 
      safety precautions were taken to assure there were no accidents while we 
      were on the firing line. Before we started to fire the 40mm guns, each 
      crew had to dig a post-hole about four feet deep in front of each gun pit 
      in order to have a place to put a shell if the gun fired but the shell did 
      not go off. This happened to us once, and it created a very uncomfortable 
      situation. When we opened the breech, we found the shell had been struck 
      by the firing pin, which meant it was a faulty shell and was considered 
      live. We had to pry the shell out of the firing chamber with a 
      screwdriver, gingerly carry it to the hole in front of the pit, set it in 
      carefully, then cover it with sand.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      the crews of the 40mm guns fired, it was time for the .50 caliber machine 
      gunners to take a turn shooting at the sleeve target pulled by the plane. 
      Even though we had our new M-51 mounts available (See Fig. 48a and 48b) 
      with their four .50 caliber guns, in this early stage of our training, we 
      used the older single .50 caliber water-cooled machinegun (See Fig. 49) we 
      still had available. The officers felt it would give the gunners a more 
      hands on feel to the .50, help to develop their aiming skills, and let 
      them get acclimated to the noise of live ammunition.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >During this first time on the firing range, the man 
      from our crew who was designated to fire caused quite a bit of excitement. 
      His name was Red because of his flaming red hair. He was short in stature, 
      exceedingly thin and easily irritated (See Fig. 50). He met the stereotype 
      description of a hotheaded red head. An Army brat, he had been raised in 
      camps as the son of a regular Army soldier. After we learned to live with 
      his ticklish personality, he was a big help to many of us because he knew 
      a lot about the Army routine. He had helped our crewmembers learn how to 
      pass inspections, how to drill, and other fundamental things relating to 
      our early training. On the day Red was to take his turn at firing, several 
      of us commented how nervous he looked, but he was kind of a nervous person 
      anyway and we passed it off as anticipation jitters. There was a rope tied 
      to his right wrist; a sergeant held the other end. It could be pulled to 
      get Red's hand off of the trigger if something went wrong, and something 
      went very wrong. The target came by, Red<img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Red" vspace="10" src="images/Red_6_50.jpg" width="150" align="right" height="396" > opened up and 
      immediately panicked. He completely lost his sense of aim. He sprayed 
      rounds all over the place and started to shoot dangerously close to the 
      other gun pits down the line. He was using tracer bullets, which made it 
      easy to observe his line of fire. The unaimed tracer streaks winding all 
      over the area instead of heading toward the target looked unreal. For some 
      reason, either the sergeant on the end of the safety rope did not pull 
      Red's hand away fast enough or Red froze on the trigger. It was later 
      concluded that by pulling the rope lightly the sergeant contributed to the 
      erratic shooting. There was a big investigation about the incident, and 
      even the pilot registered a complaint. Some men said shots came close to 
      the plane. I did not see that because after I witnessed the first erratic 
      shots, I, along with several others, was running toward Red from behind to 
      tackle him.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      the investigation, the sergeant had his stripes taken from him, and Red 
      was transferred-he was still a private so they could not demote him to a 
      lower rank-to permanent kitchen duty, where he spent the rest of the war. 
      It was sad to see Red standing behind the food containers in the mess 
      hall, dishing out chow to the men. He would have a dejected look on his 
      face and his usual response to "Hi, Red!" was a curt "Yeah" as his eyes 
      dropped down to look at the pan from which he was spooning food. When he 
      was with our gun crew, he had been a big talker, but, in the kitchen, he 
      barely spoke to his ex-crew members. Red became quite despondent because 
      he felt he had let his military father down.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A 
      fellow named Cogdill was assigned to our crew replacing Red.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Gunnery practice was more than a little interesting 
      and exciting. It kept the adrenalin rushing and we were sorry when it was 
      over. It meant we would be going back to the boring life we had been 
      living. The combination of the extreme heat, the desolate look of the 
      landscape, and the fact there was absolutely nothing to do in our spare 
      time continued to make living in the pup tent camp a real drag. We played 
      some cards and did a little reading, but mainly we sat around and talked. 
      Occasionally, a crap game would break out, usually right after payday (See 
      Fig. 51).</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Crap game World War II" src="images/Crap_Game_6_51.jpg" width="600" height="561" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      night, before going to bed, we would shake out our bedrolls and blankets. 
      There were a lot of scorpions about, and they stung a number of men. They 
      would crawl into our bedding during the day while we were away from the 
      tent area. Their sting would not usually kill, but its venom could make a 
      person violently ill. After watching the reaction of several victims, we 
      all took great pains in avoiding scorpions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      other living creatures we had about were very large jackrabbits, 
      rattlesnakes, and tarantulas. We marveled at how they could survive in 
      this hostile environment. At night, we would lie in our tents with our 
      heads at the open end, looking at the most desirable view of the desert, 
      the star-laden sky. Along the ground, the sagebrush would capture the 
      moonlight in its scraggly shapes, and out farther would be the outlines of 
      many jackrabbits with their huge ears like antennas silhouetted against 
      the sky. We commented they were like an invading army waiting for us to go 
      to sleep before advancing. We saw rabbits only at night and, even then, 
      only in silhouette. It was so quiet in the pup tents we could hear our 
      watches ticking.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Another oddball activity we practiced because of the 
      dearth of meaningful duties or entertainment was capturing snakes. We said 
      you could distinguish which men were Rebels and which were Yankees when 
      you heard a rattlesnake. The Yankee would run from it, and the Rebel would 
      run to capture it. A few Rebels would defang the snakes and wear them 
      around their necks like trophies. Most of us debated about the guys who 
      would stalk and capture rattlesnakes. Were they brave or crazy?</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      morale of the troops finally got so bad the command decided to do 
      something, and we were given a two-hour siesta every day after lunch. I'm 
      not sure if it was an effort on their part to pacify us or if they just 
      could not find anything to keep us busy in this godforsaken place. During 
      the siesta we would cover our faces with our fatigue caps and lie around 
      in or near our pup tents talking as the sun beat down on us. Also, they 
      started to bring out an ice cream truck in the evenings, a couple of times 
      a week. The driver sold only vanilla pints. Most of us ate one or two of 
      them. There were always some men who would down four or five, and contests 
      would develop to see who could eat the most.</font></p>

      >Living Conditions Continue To Get 
Worse</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      thought we had reached the bottom rung of Army life, certainly in 
      training, but we had one more step down to go.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      leaving the pup tents where they were, we loaded up our trucks, hitched 
      the 40mm's on the back, and headed deeper into the desert. We did not take 
      the M-51 mount. After dropping our fifteen-man gun crew and equipment in 
      the middle of a valley, the trucks drove off. Jeep brought our two drivers 
      back to our gun position. When the Jeeps left, there was not another 
      person or man-made thing in sight except our crewmembers. The visibility 
      was for many miles. Another negative factor-complete desolation-had been 
      added to the hostile environment of our living conditions in the Mojave 
      Desert. The entire crew just sat there on the sand for hours trying to 
      comprehend what was going on (See Fig. 52). Why were we here? What was the 
      objective? How long would we be there?</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      dug a pit for our gun, and then we just milled about under the scorching 
      sun in disbelief. Spearing and I sat in the trackers seats and pretended 
      to be aiming at enemy planes while Armbruster took our picture (See Fig. 
      53).</font></p>

      looked at the sparse landscape with the heat waves distorting the view and 
      wondered, as we had on the first day we arrived at Camp Irwin, what we had 
      done to deserve this. Even back at the pup tent camp we could move about a 
      bit to visit with other men, but here we were alone. There was no duty to 
      perform and no instructions being given, so we just sat there doing 
      nothing. (See Fig. 54) Our thoughts ranged from self-pity to rage aimed at 
      authority, any authority. Tempers became short, and we had more 
      disagreements among our crewmembers there than any other place before or 
      after.</font></p>

      the sun was going down on the first day, we laid out our bedrolls on the 
      sand (See Fig. 55). Suddenly, Armstrong yelled there was a nest of 
      tarantulas next to the gun pit where he was about to lay his bedding. We 
      killed several of them, but others got away. Some of them looked as big as 
      my fist. Their ugly, hairy appearance repulsed us to the point we actually 
      dug a hole and buried the ones we had killed to avoid having to look at 
      them. Until that time, we had considered rattlesnakes to be the nastiest 
      things we had encountered on the desert but these spiders had even greater 
      shock value. That night no one slept on the ground, but with the trucks 
      gone, we did not have too many places to go. Two of us slept on the gun 
      seats, two more on the steel gun platform, two on the halves of the 
      director box, and the rest on top of the sand bags around the gun pit. All 
      locations were extremely uncomfortable and we wound up talking through 
      most of the night.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      next day, the wind kicked up and the sand began to blow. It was not a real 
      sand storm, but it was enough to bother our eyes and, after a while, we 
      could feel sand grinding between our teeth. We huddled for most of the day 
      in the bottom of the gun pit, around the outer edge. It was a strange 
      site, all fifteen members of our crew lined up as we griped and 
      contemplated what was going on.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"What 
      do you suppose the purpose is in our being here?" asked Armstrong 
      sarcastically. "Do you think that there is some military objective that is 
      not apparent to us?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >"Sure, there's an objective," Grimes said. "The Army 
      wants to make bastards like us as miserable as possible, and they keep 
      coming up with new ways to do it. I'll bet that Montelone and his flunkies 
      are back at Camp Irwin right now having a good time and figuring out what 
      to throw at us next."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >"They're going to have to work overtime to beat this 
      hell hole," Bapst said, "but that doesn't mean that they aren't 
      trying."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      grumbling kept up for some time as we cursed the Army, the officers, and 
      the noncoms. We blamed anyone we even suspected had something to do with 
      our predicament. Even the deadly tarantula spiders that had caused such 
      concern the night before were moved down on our list of distasteful things 
      we commented on. We were blanketing anyone and everyone who had authority 
      over us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      could not or, at least, we did not eat while the wind was kicking up so 
      when it finally let up, we scrambled out of the bottom of the gun pit to 
      heat up the cans and eat some C-rations. After the long absence of food, 
      even these rations tasted good if not fulfilling.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      stayed at this site and ate rations for three days except for one meal. 
      Emerling showed up, without his stripes, on the back of a truck to serve 
      us one hot meal from large thermos containers (see Fig. 56). He had just 
      come back from being AWOL and had been reduced from a staff sergeant to a 
      private. Since he was without rank, Le Claire took the opportunity to 
      chide him about the food being cold and Emerling wasn't too happy about 
      it. He was a temperamental chef and did not take well to 
      criticism.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Lining up for chow" src="images/Chow_line_6_56.jpg" width="600" height="601" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Someone described the movements of our outfit to 
      different camps and gun sites that led us to this valley as the steps down 
      into hell. We all thought that was an exaggeration, but not much of one. 
      Starting out in Camp Haan in sunny southern California with a nearly 
      perfect climate, we went to Camp Irwin in the oppressively hot desert, 
      then to the pup tent city with more of the same heat but none of the 
      meager luxuries of life like a PX and theater, and finally this experience 
      with our gun section alone in the middle of the unbelievably desolate 
      valley. Each new location had been a downward step in living conditions. 
      One thing we were sure of: it would be difficult to get much worse than 
      where we were unless they imported some Germans or Japs to start shooting 
      at us. When several of the men commented they were beginning to understand 
      what General Sherman meant many years prior when he said, "War is hell," 
      Armstrong replied, "Yeah, and we haven't even been in the war 
      yet."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Of 
      all the negative things about this site, the worst was the intolerable 
      inaction. It sometimes felt as though time was standing still and we were 
      locked in some kind of a vacuum. Regardless of how you described the 
      location, you could never properly define the miserable living conditions 
      and the lonesome feeling we had there.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Finally the trucks returned. We loaded up and drove 
      back to the pup tent city. We never did learn the purpose of our spending 
      time in that valley doing absolutely nothing, and, as usual, nobody 
      offered any justification for it. Not that we needed much reinforcement, 
      but we all started to hate Army life really bad. We started to frequently 
      ask the question, "How do I get out of this chicken s--- 
      outfit?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      another short stay in pup tents, we loaded up again and went back to Camp 
      Irwin. Compared to where we had been, that camp was a big step up. The 
      showers alone made everyone feel better because we had not had one in 
      about a month and washing out of helmets was not getting the job done. We 
      were all pretty gamy. It was amazing how our attitude toward Camp Irwin 
      had changed. When we first arrived there, we thought it was about as bad a 
      location as you could get. After being out in the pup tent encampment and 
      the trip as a lone gun section in a valley, it did not seem nearly as bad. 
      There was even a lot of light-hearted bantering among the men as the 
      morale greatly increased. We looked on the trips to the PX and movie 
      theater with great delight.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      continued to train. We were put through several kinds of obstacle courses. 
      Some, such as jumping and climbing over hurdles, were to test our 
      endurance. Another proved more sobering if not scary. One evening, we were 
      taken to the camp's infiltration course where we had to crawl on our 
      stomachs while carrying our rifles across our arms and wearing a steel 
      helmet. There was barbed wire stretched about two feet above the ground. A 
      .30 caliber machine gun was firing over the top of that, and explosives 
      were going off around the site. When I was about halfway through the 
      course, my fatigue jacket got caught on the barbed wire and I had a 
      difficult time getting it loose. The men behind me were yelling because 
      they wanted to complete their run as quickly as possible. I wanted to get 
      loose without rising up to disentangle myself. It was a moment of fright 
      and I wound up tearing myself loose. The whole experience wasn't much fun, 
      and we were all glad when it was over. In any unusual training exercise, 
      there was always someone who would make fun of it and ridicule how some of 
      the men had fared performing it. This was the exception. Everyone seemed 
      to take it quite seriously. The feeling of fear was something new for us 
      all. Even though we tried to show brave faces, the machine gun and 
      explosives gave us a new reality of what war was really like. It was just 
      a small taste, but it did get our attention.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      spent one day at the three-story debarkation tower, climbing down nets 
      while we carried our rifles and wore a light field pack. The nets were 
      made of woven rope and were the kind used to transfer troops from large 
      ships onto assault type boats. I found it extremely difficult to climb 
      down these things and hoped I would never have to use one again. I finally 
      went over to the tower several times to practice (See Fig. 57a and 57b) 
      but it did not seem to get any easier.</font></p>

      >A Soldier Named Lenny</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">An 
      incident occurred while we were in Camp Irwin after our first pup tent 
      experience that could best be described as a fulfillment of our dreams. 
      The story starts back at Camp Haan when a new soldier was transferred into 
      our outfit. We were told he had just been released from the military 
      prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. We did not know what he had been in 
      for, but it's a prison for only serious offenses. Is this where they send 
      ex-cons, to join our Battalion? we asked ourselves. He was a big, 
      raw-boned guy who weighed well over two hundred pounds and stood about six 
      feet, two inches tall. He was badly stooped over with drooping shoulders; 
      walked with a slow gait with his arms barely moving, and talked to no one. 
      His face was contorted into a continuous scowl. His fatigue jacket was as 
      big as a tent and its arms hung to the middle of his palms. Either he 
      didn't give a darn about the fit or he was trying to make some kind of a 
      statement. His posture, size, and ill-fitting uniform made him stand out 
      like a sore thumb. We called him Lenny behind his back because he reminded 
      us of the doltish character in John Steinbeck's novel, Of Mice and Men. We 
      were all afraid of him because he looked like he could get really nasty 
      and the only people we knew of who had been in prison had notorious names 
      like Capone and Dillinger.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><br 
      >One morning at about 0430 hours, we were awakened to 
      go out to the rifle range for more qualifying. It was still dark, and the 
      only light was coming from the few electric light bulbs on the latrine and 
      mess hall buildings. First Sergeant Monteleone was going down the line of 
      six-man tents with a flashlight to get everyone up and out of bed. He was 
      in his usual vile and ugly mood. "Fall out in formation you f---ing 
      people!" he kept yelling. The trip to the latrine would have to wait until 
      later. Whatever it was he had to say to us had to be said right now. We 
      fumbled about in darkness using flashlights to find our clothing and 
      shoes. As usual, we were cursing our leggings, which required too much 
      time to put on despite the fact we had devised several shortcuts for doing 
      it. After dressing quickly, we hurried out and stood in four rows facing 
      Montelone. He was yelling at the latecomers and anyone else who made a 
      wrong move.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      we had been there for about five minutes listening to his tirade, one of 
      the staff sergeants flushed Lenny out of his tent. Everyone else was still 
      at rigid attention. Instead of hurrying into the formation, Lenny slowly 
      meandered over to the end of the first row of soldiers and stood there in 
      a stance not even remotely resembling attention. I was in the row behind 
      him and a couple of spaces to the side. I could smell trouble brewing, 
      although I was not prepared for what finally happened. He was still 
      buttoning up the front of his oversized fatigue jacket with all the 
      casualness of someone oblivious to what was going on around him. He wore 
      the usual dour expression on his face. His leggings were nowhere to be 
      seen and his shoes were untied.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Monteleone was speechless as he watched for the 
      minute or two it took Lenny to complete his buttoning task. Then 
      Monteleone walked over to him and put his face in Lenny's and began to 
      shout at him. With Moneleone's short stature he was looking almost 
      straight up while Lenny's curved body arching over the master of filthy 
      language. In between the curse words, Monteleone was telling him to stand 
      up straight and assume the position of attention.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Although Lenny was probably only in his late 
      twenties, he was so stoop-shouldered I don't think he was capable of 
      standing erect. Suddenly, Lenny smashed Monteleone in the face with his 
      fist, knocking him to the ground. Then he pounced on him, throwing punches 
      with both fists. From the sound of the blows, it was obvious that some 
      real damage was being done. There was a lot of commotion as other 
      high-ranking noncoms came to Monteleone's aid. Lenny hit them also.<br 
      >The rest of us twisted our faces into masks of deep 
      concern, but inside we were enjoying every minute of it. It took four men 
      to pin Lenny down. He finally stopped fighting when they tied his hands 
      behind him. Monteleone went to the hospital, but, unfortunately, came back 
      in about a week. They told us Lenny was sent back to Camp Haan for his 
      punishment. While in formation one day soon after that incident, one of 
      the cadre members commented, "That f---ing big ape is gonna spend the rest 
      of his life bustin rocks with a ten-pound sledgehammer at Leavenworth 
      (prison)."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Actually, we saw Lenny several times after that on 
      prison work details back at Camp Haan where he was being held in the camp 
      stockade. He could have been there awaiting a court martial. We never did 
      find out what finally happened to him. The soldier-prisoners, like Lenny, 
      wore fatigues similar to ours only a dark blue color. We commented 
      facetiously that at least his new uniform fit him better than what he had 
      worn while with us. That prison garb had a large white P stenciled on the 
      back of the jacket and the prisoners were called yard birds. But Lenny was 
      no yard bird; he was our hero.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Soon 
      after the fight, we packed up and went back to Camp Haan. We had an 
      exciting time on the trip back. A few miles out of Camp Irwin, our truck 
      got a flat tire so we stopped while the convoy went on ahead. It was one 
      of the many tire problems we would have over the months we were in 
      California. After fixing the flat, our truck moved once more. As we 
      climbed into the mountain pass, we were in low gear and the truck strained 
      under the heavy load. When we reached the mountain peak, the driver, 
      Grimes, was supposed to leave the truck in the lowest gear so the gears 
      would be available for breaking, if necessary, on the trip down. (State 
      police were often stationed on motorcycles near the peak to assure the 
      civilian trucks met this requirement but they had no authority over army 
      vehicles.) Instead, Grimes shifted into high gear and we began the 
      downhill run. The traffic was light. Because of a governor, the maximum 
      speed of a two-and a-half ton truck was sixty miles-per-hour on a level 
      surface, but on a steep downhill incline and with a very heavy load 
      pushing us along, we soon passed that limit. We crewmembers felt we were 
      far exceeding a speed where Grimes could control the truck. It was a 
      winding two-lane road, and as we rounded a turn, there were two tanker 
      trucks about one-hundred-fifty feet ahead of us, in our lane, creeping 
      down the hill in low gear. We could not have stopped in five times that 
      distance. The only alternative, to running into the back of them was to 
      move into the left lane and go around the tankers. This we did. The 
      distance from one end of our assembly to the other was more than 
      thirty-five feet. We had the length of the truck, a long draw bar, and the 
      gun itself lined up in a row, and they all had to clear both trucks. We 
      were still accelerating, and it felt like we were doing a hundred miles 
      per hour. There were no cars in the oncoming lane until we were almost 
      past the lead truck. Then we spotted a car headed toward us. It scraped 
      along the guardrail as the driver made a desperate attempt to keep from 
      getting hit head-on. Grimes swerved back into the downhill lane before he 
      wanted to, narrowly missing more oncoming traffic also pinned against the 
      guardrail. The flash protector at the end of the barrel of the gun just 
      clipped the cab of the lead truck. We kept going, screeching around curves 
      in the road until Grimes was able to slow us down to a more sensible 
      speed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Back 
      in camp, we found the flash protector was slightly dented and had red 
      paint on it. We cleaned off the paint and did our best to fix the dent, 
      with no success. It wasn't until several weeks later anyone noticed it. We 
      claimed we had no idea how it happened.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Camp 
      Haan seemed like a four-star luxury hotel compared to the places we had 
      been in the desert. We said we would never gripe about conditions there 
      again, but we did. It took only a few days before we started to do so as 
      we continued our training.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      a year in California, those of us who were eligible were awarded Good 
      Conduct Medals. They went to anyone who had not committed any serious 
      offense in the previous year. The cadre members managed to deflate any 
      minor amount of pride we had in receiving our first army medal. They 
      described the award in their usual crass manner by saying, "You have to 
      have avoided getting the clap (a social disease) during that time," to be 
      eligible. We took the medal and the ribbon; and put them away with our 
      gear. There was an unwritten law that we would wear ribbons only when we 
      had three of them and we were still a long way from that goal. We knew 
      anyone wearing the ribbon for a Good Conduct Medal alone would be laughed 
      at unmercifully.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      started a volleyball team (see Fig. 57c) to play other battalions in 
      camp.&nbsp;</font> </p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Camp Haan, Battalion Volleyball Team, 1943" src="images/Volleyball_Team_6_57c.jpg" width="700" height="627" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      had all played a lot of basketball, so the transition to volleyball was 
      easy for us. Our coach, Andy Anderson was one of the older members of our 
      unit and considered more a father figure by the younger men. He had 
      experience in coaching, and he developed us into a very good team. Andy 
      did have one quirk. He thought that Coca Cola had some kind of therapeutic 
      value and insisted we drink some before every game. "It cleans out your 
      system and gives you hidden energy," he would say. We didn't believe it 
      for a minute but we did enjoy the Coke, especially since he paid for it. I 
      had never played volleyball before entering the Army but I had a lot of 
      fun doing so, especially when we started to win every game. Later we would 
      take a bus to play teams at other camps and at March Air Force Base across 
      the road. We also played softball, but it was twelve-inch fast pitching 
      with gloves. I found out the sixteen-inch slow pitch game I was raised 
      playing was exclusively a Chicago area sport. We had</font> <font size="3" 
      face=Arial>a great twelve-inch pitcher so we spent 
      most of the time during the games just standing there watching him strike 
      out the opposition players.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      made two more trips to the Mojave Desert for gunnery practice. Each time 
      things<br>seemed to be a little better. We would 
      adapt to the harsh environment faster and we learned little tricks that 
      made things more livable. On our last trip, we found they had paved the 
      road from Barstow to the camp (See Fig. 58) making that part of the trip 
      more comfortable.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Road between Barstow and Camp Irwin" src="images/New_road_Barstow_to_Camp_Irwin_6_58.jpg" width="500" height="401" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Also, 
      when we went out to the range and lived in pup tents again, they set up a 
      wash house (See Fig. 59a) so we could take showers. These little amenities 
      meant a lot as we grasped for ways to make living there more 
      comfortable.<br></font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >During one of these later trips, we found that the 
      desert can get cold. There were times when we wore our wool OD uniforms 
      under fatigues to protect against it. Wool hats and overcoats even showed 
      up on some downright cold mornings </font><font size="3" face="Arial"

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I had 
      adapted to Army life. I really did not expect much good to happen to me 
      and the worst part was, it did not seem that important. It was just a 
      matter of doing my job, staying out of trouble and, enjoying whatever 
      small pleasures, like participating in sports, that were available. 
      However, I had one great longing on my mind that had to be resolved before 
      I could be at peace with myself.</font></p>
