    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The convoy took us northwest. When it got
    dark, we began to stake out places on the truck to bed down. We finally
    reached our destination at about 0200 hours on the morning of March 24th. We
    pulled off the road and were guided to a parking place. As usual, we
    wondered where we were but knew better than to ask. It was pitch black. The
    only thing we could see was several men with flashlights moving about on the
    ground. Once the truck engines stopped we could hear voices coming from
    several directions, but we did not know what was going on. We had expected
    to unload, but when nobody showed up to tell us to, we crawled back to our
    makeshift bunks on the truck and tried to sleep. The voices continued
    throughout the night, and someone in authority was yelling out commands for
    hours.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It had been raining since we left Alzey, and
    it was still raining when we awoke at dawn. As we looked out the back of our
    truck, the overcast sky gave a very depressing look to the landscape. We
    disconnected the 40mm drawbar from the truck, took the pins out of the
    tailgate, and dropped it to the down position. This gave us a stirrup-like
    step on each side of the truck about halfway to the ground that made it
    easier to dismount. Standing on the soggy ground, we went through some
    stretching exercises to limber up. Although sleeping on the truck kept us
    dry, the cramped quarters made our muscles stiff, and we needed to move
    about to loosen up.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The battery field kitchen was not set up yet
    because the cooks had no access to supplies at this remote site, so we were
    still on rations. Sergeant Emerling put out a garbage can filled with
    boiling water and some of the men dropped in cans of C-rations to heat them.
    It caused quite a stir because, with many dozens of cans that all looked
    alike except for some small print lying together, it was nearly impossible
    to get back what you had put in. Men were complaining. "I dropped in a
    can of scrambled eggs and ham and got back one containing some lousy
    stew." "Mine was in there for ten minutes and this one is barely
    heated." Finally, one of the cooks who had been scooping out the cans
    with a shovel and was the object of the most abuse decided that it was all a
    bad idea. He spilled the contents of the garbage can out on the ground with
    the comment, "Go fish!" I had just approached the container of
    heated water with my can of ration when the container was tipped over, so I
    wound up eating cold hash that morning for breakfast.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were in the midst of a large bivouac area
    and there were a lot of GIs in every direction we looked. Across the road
    from us was an encampment of hundreds of men who, we found out later, were
    part of the infantry. They were standing around in the light rain near a
    wooded area and looked quite glum. There were no buildings in which to take
    cover, and the few tents that had been pitched were set up for their
    headquarters (translation: for the officers). The GIs were all standing
    around in groups with their raincoats or ponchos on. Their helmets and coats
    were shining from being wet; and the men had their M-1 rifle slung upside
    down over their shoulders and under their raingear. The ends of the barrels
    protruded a few inches down past the bottom of their rain gear. We assumed
    trucks parked down the road had brought them to the area but for some reason
    they could not use them for shelter. We felt fortunate we always had a dry
    place to go when it rained, even in a remote assembly area like this. We
    were getting very attached to our trucks, and we felt somewhat sorry for
    those who didn't have one as a base camp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were other trucks and soldiers down the
    road in the other direction that appeared to be an ordinance unit. The road
    they were on led into a heavily wooded area. The trucks were laden with
    equipment and supplies. Their drivers had set up a piece of canvas between
    two of the trucks, and about a dozen of the drivers were huddled under it to
    avoid the rain, most of them smoking cigarettes. They were all sitting on
    five-gallon gas cans and they did not have their guns with them. Unlike the
    men from the infantry unit, these drivers did not seem nearly as glum. In
    fact, they were taking turns telling jokes, and uproarious laughter would
    come from them every few minutes. We commented on the difference in moods
    between the two groups, and Bapst said, "It's not hard to pick out the
    guys who are gonna fight the Krauts and those who will just deliver the
    K-rations."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Off in the distance were some very large
    artillery pieces. From their immense size, we speculated they were 155mm
    howitzers, the biggest tactical guns the Army had. Someone pointed out the
    powder charges stacked near the guns were separate from the shell; that
    definitely identified them as 155mm guns. They were set up in position to
    fire so we knew we were not a great distance from the enemy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Early in the afternoon we heard some rumbling
    noises from what must have been heavy artillery off in the distance. It
    continued on and off for several hours. It created a certain amount of
    anxiety among our crew even though we were all trying to look nonchalant.
    The men located down the road in ordinance had given up their joke telling
    and were back on their trucks. The infantrymen were snaking around in
    several long lines to get cups of hot water and what looked like K-rations
    from their kitchen personnel. We kept glancing at the 155mm guns in
    anticipation of their firing, but they remained silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Nothing went on at our site for most of the
    day, so we just hung out around our trucks, and occasionally moved around to
    talk with friends in other gun sections. The rain stopped late in the
    afternoon. While we were still not told anything about what was going on, it
    was obvious from the amount of men, artillery, and supplies at this site
    something big was in the offing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were about to participate in a major
    operation to cross the Rhine River, which was considered the Germans' last
    bastion of defense and the symbolic line of their heartland. We started to
    hear a rumor passed down to us by headquarters personnel that the American
    Army had crossed the Rhine River at several locations, including one by the
    Third Army at a town called Nierstein near our previous gun position at
    Alzey, but, like all rumors, we did not know if it was reliable. Until we
    reached this location, it didn't really matter to us.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Even though the Third Army had made their
    successive crossing at Nierstein and Oppenheim and their tanks were now
    fanning out into the German heartland, the going was not without resistance
    and the Twelfth Army Group Engineer report stated: "The tactical
    situation required that the strong German resistance met in the vicinity of
    Frankfurt by the forces that crossed at Oppenheim be enveloped from the
    north." This meant that there had to be other crossings of the Rhine
    farther to the west. (Near where we were located). The assignment was given
    to the VIII Corps. They would use the 87th Infantry Division north of a town
    called Boppard and the 89th Infantry Division south of there. The 76th
    Infantry Division would spread out over both Divisions, offer support to
    them, and fire on targets across the river. They would be prepared to
    advance through the bridgeheads once temporary bridges across the river had
    been constructed.1</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition to their own artillery and
    engineering units, these three infantry divisions had multiple units of
    armor, antiaircraft, supply, and additional artillery attached to them for
    the crossing. There was a total of three-hundred-four artillery pieces
    capable of firing in support of the assault.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although we did not know it at the time, we
    in the 815th Antiaircraft Battalion were attached to the 89th Infantry
    Division for this crossing.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The overall plan was to start with a
    "silent crossing" of the Rhine River at each of the (89th
    Division's) three sites. Thirty minutes prior to H-hour (the time of the
    start of the major crossing), each assault unit was to send out a patrol of
    one squad to place guide lights on the far shore for the first wave. The
    purpose was to direct the assault units to a specific location for the
    concentration of firepower. Each assault unit commander desired to send
    across two rifle companies in the first wave. Two telephone cables were to
    be laid at each crossing. Boats of the first wave were to be assault boats
    powered by oars. The engineers were to paddle the boat and direct it across
    while the riflemen of the infantry would be their passengers. The assault
    boats of the first wave were to be ferried back to the near shore by
    motorboat. Subsequent crossings were to be made by motorboats. The crossings
    were to be continued until the entire assault unit was across. Ferries were
    to be constructed and put into operation at each site as soon as small arms
    (s/a) and automatic-weapons (a/w) fire at the sites were eliminated. In
    addition, a floating treadway bridge was to be constructed at the town of
    St. Goar as soon as small arms (s/a), automatic weapons (a/w) and observed
    artillery fire had been eliminated from the opposite side of the river.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Scouting For Gun Positions</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At about 2000 hours that evening, one of our
    officers, Lieutenant Kraft, came up to our truck and told several of us we
    were going up ahead to scout for places to put our guns. We had no idea how
    far ahead he meant. He picked out Dillon, Grimes, and me to go with him. We
    thought we were going in his Jeep, but he said it was having some mechanical
    problems. We were told we were near the Rhine River and the Germans were on
    the other side. It was welcome news to get even a smattering of information
    about our location but we were suspicious of the reason.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kraft said, "We'll take your
    two-and-a-half ton truck," as he pointed at Grimes."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We thought, A two-and-a-half ton truck on a
    reconnaissance mission? That's what he said!<br>
    Several of us grabbed the drawbar of the 40mm gun and rolled the gun to the
    side so the truck could be moved. We had seen Kraft carrying a map as he
    headed toward our truck, and we were reminded of the maxim, The most
    dangerous thing in the world is a second lieutenant with a map and a roster.
    Kraft was a first lieutenant, but the difference was minor enough not to
    affect the truth of the adage. He had the map, and Dillon, Grimes and I were
    on his roster.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kraft climbed into the cab of the truck next
    to Grimes, who was the regular driver. Dillon and I mounted the back end and
    sat on 40mm boxes of ammunition. Le Claire and Bernal were standing on the
    ground near the back of the truck, and they were needling Dillon and me
    about the trip.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Keep your ass down, your head up and
    your rifles ready," said Bernal with a snicker.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"If Grimes gets another flat, see if you
    can get those Krauts to come over on this side and help you change it.
    Remember where your home is and don't forget to write," chided Le
    Claire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Blow it out your ass," responded
    Dillon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although we had been at this site all day and
    part of the night before, we had not seen a single vehicle head toward the
    river. Why not? Did the American Army control the land right up to the
    water's edge? If they did, why weren't they being supplied along this road?
    All Kraft had said was the Germans were on the other side. We had a lot of
    questions, and at the time they seemed quite important. The most important
    one was, what were we getting in to?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We headed northeast, leaving the security of
    the many troops and equipment in the bivouac area. The Rhine River flows
    from the southeast to the northwest in the area where we were. We traveled
    about five miles on a two-lane road through a dense forest and then over a
    flat, relatively open area for about two more miles. It was dark, and we
    traveled with the truck's night lights (sometimes called blackout lights)
    on, which meant it was like having no lights at all. They were just little
    slits on the truck's covered headlights that could be seen only from about
    thirty feet away by someone approaching us head-on. They threw no light at
    all on the road. Off in the distance we could see the outline of some hills
    but nothing else. If there were any houses along the open area, they showed
    no lights and were not visible to us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The moon was more than half full that night
    but it was visible only part of the time because of the many clouds in the
    sky. When the moon was out, Grimes would speed up, because he could see the
    road more clearly. When it went behind the clouds, he had to slow down
    considerably.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not sure Kraft would have picked Grimes
    to be the driver that night if he knew about his driving skills, or lack
    thereof, as well as we did. Even though he had been driving an Army truck
    now for more than a year and a half, he still seemed to have trouble
    shifting gears. Each movement into another gear when he tried to double
    clutch resulted in a loud grinding of teeth. But that wasn't his only
    problem, and because we were always riding with him, they were our problems,
    too. He was very unlucky and more than a little reckless. In convoys,
    whenever we made an extended stop, it was part of the truck driver's job to
    get out and check for flat tires. The dual tires in the rear had to be
    kicked to see if they had lost air. Grimes seemed to have many more flats
    than anyone else, and, because we helped him change the tires, we encouraged
    him to ignore some of those where he had dual wheels. His recklessness was
    something we liked sometimes and hated others. He drove his truck like it
    was a sports car, or at least a Jeep, within the limits that its size
    presented. As young men, most of the rest of the crew enjoyed the thrill of
    speed and sharp turns; but there were times when the close calls we had were
    downright nerve-racking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we proceeded toward the river, we kept
    expecting Kraft to order the truck to stop on the flat area before we
    reached the rim where the land dropped off dramatically into the deep valley
    where the river flowed. Surely, he wasn't taking us down to the river when
    the German army was supposed to be entrenched on the other side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We came to the rim and headed down into the valley.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had not passed another vehicle since we
    left the bivouac area, and there were none on the road going down. "If
    this is American territory, where are the GIs?" Dillon blurted out.
    Grimes had the truck in a very low gear to help in braking, and we were
    crawling down the very steep and winding road at a relatively slow speed.
    When the moon was out, we could see clearly across the river and it gave us
    a very eerie feeling. If we could see across so clearly, the Germans could
    see us just as well. We now knew why there was no traffic on the road.
    Anybody on the other side had a clear view across the valley and a moving
    vehicle would be a real standout. Because of the apprehension we felt, the
    trip seemed much longer than it actually was. We finally got down into the
    town spread out along the bank of the river. There was a strange silence
    about the area. A burning smell and smoke were coming from the underside of
    the truck. It was the brake pads; Grimes had been riding the brakes all the
    way down the steep embankment in order to reduce our speed. The smoke soon
    dissipated, but the smell lasted much longer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The buildings in the town were spread out
    about five blocks deep from the river and extended about a mile along its
    length. We turned down a street parallel to the Rhine and one block away
    from it. It was the main street, Heerstrasse. The moon's rays bathed one
    side of the street in light while the other side was covered in shadows.
    There were little shops on both sides that were closed and out of business.
    The buildings were all three stories high with no space between them. They
    had that typical Bavarian look about them with high-pitched roofs and wood
    beams imbedded in the stucco exteriors. Above the stores were apartments,
    but there was no sign of the civilians who lived there. All of the windows
    were dark and the fact there was still glass in them was unusual. A few of
    the buildings were slightly damaged, but compared to other towns in Germany
    we had observed, overall it was in good shape. The wet cobblestone street
    and narrow sidewalks were polished smooth from wear and shone like mirrors
    in the moonlight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was no firing going on from either
    side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"If this is suppose to be the dividing
    line between the German and American armies, what happened to the shooting
    war?" I asked Dillon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Yeah, this is quieter than the bivouac
    area we just came from, which is fine with me," he replied. "Let's
    hope it stays that way until we get the hell out of here."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"This doesn't make sense," I said.
    "I would expect there would be wall-to-wall troops and even some
    armament around here. Maybe Kraft got lost."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"If he did, I hope he decides to
    backtrack in a hurry," responded Dillon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we proceeded down the street we saw only a
    few soldiers at first but as we continued on, we realized that there were a
    lot of GIs around. They were mainly in the shops, but some were sitting on
    the sidewalk in front. The ones on the sidewalk had their backs against the
    shops and their rifles across their laps. Many of them were sitting on their
    helmets because the ground was still wet from the earlier rain. We saw
    several assault boats leaning on their sides against the buildings next to
    the street and there were some mortars set up on one side of the street.
    Kraft asked the men in one of the mortar crews where their CP (Command Post)
    was, and they identified a shop about a block further down from where we
    were. They said, "Look for the Lowenbrau (beer) sign." It was the
    first time I had heard that name. We never found the beer sign and later I
    wondered if someone was pulling our legs. After another inquiry, we found
    the CP and parked in front it. I noticed we were the only truck visible in
    the village. I don't know how the assault boats and troops got down there,
    but there may have been trucks parked away from the river on the other
    streets not visible to us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kraft, Dillon, and I went into the CP, while
    Grimes stayed with the truck. Inside it was quite dark. As we moved toward
    the middle of a large room we came upon about twenty GIs, some of whom were
    sitting while others were lying on the floor. They were not doing anything
    in particular except relaxing. We stood facing them, and Kraft appeared
    upset everyone did not jump to attention. The silence produced tension.
    There was a red glow from several cigarettes. It was too dark to see faces
    and only enough light to make out their outlines. They said nothing, and,
    after an uncomfortable long pause, we turned to see four more men standing
    at a long bar at the far end of the room They had been looking at a map laid
    out on the bar in front of them, but they were now looking up at us. One of
    the men had a hand resting on an army telephone in its heavy leather case
    but it remained silent while we were there. Several candles on each side of
    the map gave the only light, other than the glow of cigarettes, in the
    place. The candles threw a yellow light that gleamed on the men's faces with
    a brightness that made them look like masks. The light also created
    distorted shadows on the wall behind them. Two of them glanced at each other
    with an expression that said, And, who do we have here?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We walked over to the four, and Kraft asked
    one of the men, "Who's in charge here?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of them said, "I am," in a very
    surly tone. "And who the hell are you?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kraft was getting upset at such
    insubordination from what he thought were enlisted men. One of them showed
    the stripes of a staff sergeant, but the other three showed no rank. None
    wore helmets. All four men needed shaves, and their uniforms were heavily
    rumpled. Kraft was dressed like he was going to the officers' ball in the
    States. His spotless trench coat, well-shined boots, perfectly creased
    pants, and silver first lieutenant bar on the collar of his starched shirt
    all reeked of rear echelon. He must have been oblivious of the need to hide
    all signs of rank in a combat zone. They were like beacons in the night to
    identify officers who would become the first targets for German snipers. As
    the evening progressed, we began to wonder if Kraft even realized he was
    within small arms shooting distance of the enemy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Before Kraft could say anything more, the man
    who had spoken introduced himself as a major and two of the others as
    captains, all with last names included. Then Kraft identified himself by
    rank, name and unit. One of the captains shot a look at the major. The staff
    sergeant, Dillon, and I were not introduced (part of the officer's code?),
    having been designated to the status of potted plants. It was like we didn't
    exist. The major said they were part of the 89th Division, but he did not
    identify their unit as either engineers or infantry. Maybe they were both.
    The major spoke with great authority in his voice; there was no need to
    question he was the man in charge. The next question out of his mouth to
    Kraft was, "What are you doing here, anyhow?" Our truck was
    visible through the tavern window and before Kraft could answer the first
    question, he asked, "Did you really come down here in that goddamn
    truck? What the hell are you doing here?" All of the officers seemed to
    be quite upset with Kraft as the other two picked up after the major and
    took turns telling him about their displeasure. Kraft was well taken back by
    being spoken to in this curt manner. The fact it was being done in front of
    his enlisted men made it worse. They told him they had not even brought a
    Jeep down that road in some time for fear of being shot at by the Germans
    across the river. They felt that our truck would just draw fire. "Don't
    you have any Jeeps in your outfit, lieutenant?" asked one of the
    captains. Kraft didn't answer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">They told us we were in the town of St. Goar,
    and across the river was the town of St. Goarshausen. And, yes, the Germans
    were firmly entrenched over there (See Fig. 90 &amp; Fig. 91).</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kraft told the officers we were there
    reconnoitering for antiaircraft gun positions. They looked surprised and one
    of the captains raised an eyebrow and shot a glance of disbelief at the
    major. They told Kraft in no uncertain terms he should be out of St. Goar by
    2300 hours because they were going to simulate a river crossing in boats at
    that time. We checked our watches and it was past 2200 hours. They explained
    that pretending to make an assault across the river would be a sham to
    divert the German forces away from another town farther down the river where
    the Americans were crossing that night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As part of the overall plan, the 87th
    Infantry Division of the VIII Corps was scheduled to start their crossing at
    midnight, that night (In just two and a half hours). That Division was
    concentrated eight miles downstream of St. Goar, to the left of the 89th,
    between the towns of Boppard and Rhens.<strike>3</strike></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The officers told us the actual crossing at
    this site by the 89th would come sometime later but they did not specify
    when.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Orders had already been passed down from the
    Third Army Command to carry out the assault phase of the 89th Rhine River
    crossing during the night of March 25-26 (the following night). The 89th
    Division was to concentrate between the towns of Bingen and Boppart, a
    distance of thirty-five miles. Three sites were designated for the crossings
    within those limits: Site 1 was located three-quarters of a mile south of
    Oberweissel; Site 2 was at St. Goar (where we were); and Site 3 was at
    Wellmich.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The 168th Engineering Combat Battalion, as
    part of this Division, was now out reconnoitering this area. They found the
    river ran in a deep gorge for the full length of the operation and the steep
    banks would make it extremely difficult to get equipment down to the river's
    edge without it being detected. The river itself was another obstacle with
    its swift and treacherous currents. Also, the terrain offered the Germans a
    sizable advantage in being able to observe and fire from elevated positions.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The officers said they had been under
    artillery, mortar, and small arms fire that afternoon. They informed us the
    enemy artillery was somewhere back away from the valley and there were
    antiaircraft positions closer to the rim. They did not think the Germans had
    any tanks over in the main part of the town of St. Goarshausen, but they
    weren't sure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Wow! Our first intelligence
    briefing," I whispered to Dillon sarcastically as we were leaving.<br>
    As we walked out the door of the tavern, we motioned to Grimes to come and
    join us. I looked at the truck and wondered what the officers Kraft had just
    been talking to would say if they knew what was in it. It held about 1,000
    rounds of 40mm ammunition, twenty pounds of TNT, forty-eight hand grenades,
    half a dozen five-gallon cans of gasoline, and about fifteen boxes of .30
    caliber rifle ammunition. If a mortar or artillery shell had hit that truck
    while it was parked there, the explosion would have wiped out the CP and
    everything else in the area.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Grimes caught up to us, and we all continued
    down the street for about four more blocks. When we came to cross streets
    perpendicular to the river, we ran fast, one at a time, across them for fear
    of being shot at from across the river. We came to a point where we were at
    the last building in town. Beyond that point, there was a small park with
    scattered trees, and beyond that an open area with no visible buildings. We
    stopped for a minute where we still had a building to shield us from being
    seen by the Germans across the Rhine. Kraft looked at Dillon and said,
    "Your gun goes right out there tonight," as he pointed into the
    park.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Dillon looked at Grimes and me like he had
    not heard Kraft right. His mouth went agape and his large eyes bulged even
    larger. Dillon was one of those people whose face told exactly what he was
    thinking, and nobody could look as surprised as him when he was startled.
    His look of bewilderment under any other circumstances would have been
    interpreted as comical but not this time. He, Grimes, and I were all
    thinking the same thing: how do we dig in out in the open like that? We
    would be perfect targets for anyone across the river. The Germans would be
    looking and shooting down at us from the sloping ground on the other side.
    It would be doubtful we could even get a gun pit built, much less man it.
    And, what in the hell did he mean by tonight? Didn't he hear the
    major tell him to get out of town by 2300 hours? If they were going to make
    it a sham crossing, didn't that mean there was to be no crossing in this
    village tonight? What was he going to do, bring an antiaircraft battalion
    down that road before the infantry and engineers had even made an assault
    across the river?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We knew that Kraft was a ninety-day wonder
    (ninety days of training to make an officer and a gentleman), but, up until
    that night, we had not thought of him as being outright dumb. He made no
    indication he either saw or knew what we were thinking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we were fumbling for something to say, he
    said, "Let's get going," and the three of us began to follow him
    submissively. We figured he would head back into town. Instead, he started
    toward the river. Evidently, he was still looking for places to set up gun
    positions, but we asked no questions because our thoughts were still reeling
    from the last thing he said about digging in out in the open park. It seemed
    prudent to keep our mouths shut. We had no fear the enemy could hear us
    across the river, but there was enough apprehension on our part words did
    not come naturally. We stayed close to the buildings because the moon was
    out and it was now quite bright. The shadows of the buildings were hiding
    us, or at least that's what we were hoping. We turned the corner and were
    now out in front of the buildings facing the river, still in the shadows,
    walking parallel to the river. The water was swift, and I thought the
    engineers were going to have a tough time navigating it in the small boats
    we had just seen. The moon shone silver on the water and any boats would be
    easily distinguishable. We were about one hundred feet in from the bank of
    the river, with only an occasional tree in between. We could make out the
    buildings and some of the finest details on the other side. I kept glancing
    over at several open windows in buildings facing the river. What a great
    places for snipers, I thought. We could not see anyone or anything moving
    over there except a window shutter moving in the wind. Each time I looked
    across, my eyes would always fix on that shutter as if it had some special
    meaning. It might have been because it was the only moving thing we could
    see. We were all in single file. Dillon was right in front of me. He kept
    his helmet turned toward the other side of the river. He probably figured if
    someone over there was taking a bead on his head, the bullet might ricochet
    off the helmet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was still no firing going on in the
    valley, and it was quiet except for the rushing noise of the river. As we
    looked down the Rhine, we saw there had not been a permanent bridge between
    the two towns. We assumed the civilians had used a ferryboat to go back and
    forth, but we saw no sign of one. Down toward the other end of St.
    Goarshausen we saw several barges tied up at the shore. On our side of the
    river was an abutment with the stub of a temporary bridge. Again, we
    speculated the bridge had been originally built by the German army to span
    the river. They then destroyed it as they retreated across it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We walked until we came to the first street
    perpendicular to the river. It was over one hundred and fifty feet to the
    shadows on the other side and we were nervous about running across the
    moonlighted area with no protection. Even Kraft seemed apprehensive. Until
    then, we felt he did not fully understand the significance of the enemy
    being only a few hundred feet away or why would he have gotten us into this
    situation? Certainly, selecting gun positions could have waited until the
    opposite side of the river had been secured. We waited several minutes,
    hoping the moon would go behind some clouds, but the clouds were starting to
    clear out. Finally, we held our rifles out in front of us in high port and
    started to race across the open area, each about twenty feet apart from each
    other. The bright moon shone down like a spotlight. Kraft was first, I was
    second, and Dillon was next, while Grimes was still back in the shadows
    getting ready to follow us. Kraft got a little more than halfway across when
    a command from the darkness across the street rang out, "Halt!" We
    froze in our tracks. The three of us were standing in the moonlight like
    clay ducks in a well-lit shooting gallery. Adrenaline mixed with fear
    started to run heavily. We were so startled by the challenge no one said
    anything immediately. Perhaps we should have anticipated something like this
    happening but we didn't. It was now up to us to give the first part of the
    password for that night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, Kraft said, "What do you want,
    the password?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">What do you think they want, you idiot? I
    thought.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We heard someone in the shadows say,
    "They don't know it!"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite the rushing noise being made by the
    river, we could hear the distinct click of the safety catches being released
    on about a half-dozen M-1 rifles. We could not see who was in the shadows,
    but we knew they were GIs on sentry duty. My heart leaped into my mouth,
    (although it might have been there since we first headed down into the
    valley), and my mouth suddenly became very dry. I wondered if I could speak
    and felt my breathing getting heavy as if I had run a long distance. Dillon,
    Grimes, and I finally shouted out at about the same time,
    "Fourth!" with some of the responses coming out sounding quite
    feeble. The password for that day and night was Fourth and the response was
    July. The guards answered with "July" and told us to proceed into
    the shadows with them. We yelled for Grimes to come across, and he did. I
    never saw Grimes run so fast.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">They questioned us while they had their guns with the safety latches off
    trained on us. First they wanted to know who we were and why we were there.
    When Kraft told them, there was absolutely no response. There was a long
    pause and finally they asked where we lived in the States. When Dillon and I
    both said "Chicago," one of the men on guard said he was also from
    there, and he began to ask about specific sites in that city. Evidently,
    they were still not convinced of our identity. "How far north is Foster
    Avenue?" "Where's Senn High School?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Dillon had all the answers right off the top
    of his head, and it was good that he did. I just stood there quiet because
    evidently, this guy asking the questions was from the North side of the city
    of which I knew nothing about. As a Southsider, I could have done better
    with questions about Central Africa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After a few more questions, we convinced them
    who we were. After that, they began asking more about our unit. When we told
    them we were with a 40mm antiaircraft outfit, one of them asked, "What
    the hell are you guys doing here in this town?" Nobody answered. This
    was the second time this question had come up that evening. It seemed to be
    a mystery to everyone but Kraft. One of the guards also commented,
    "You're lucky you didn't get nailed out there. I wouldn't step out in
    that moonlight for ten days in Paris."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">That last comment was an indirect
    condemnation of Kraft's leadership, and I knew he wanted to get going. He
    did not like what he had encountered down in the town of St. Goar: the
    officers in the CP had berated him and now an enlisted man was ridiculing
    him. Finally, we headed inland and turned back down Heerstrasse toward our
    parked truck. Kraft picked up his pace and said nothing. The rest of us
    followed along, also not speaking, but our thoughts ran wild with strong
    feelings of disapproval for our leader.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was a very scary few minutes we had just
    gone through. I don't know what was going through Kraft's mind back there,
    but his nonchalant attitude indicated he had no idea how close we all came
    to getting killed either by the Germans on the other side of the river or by
    our own men on guard duty. Fortunately for us, the Germans did not have
    sharpshooters looking for movement across the river, and we wondered if they
    were really over there. Had they pulled out of the town without the GIs
    knowing? Those questions would soon be answered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kraft had evidently given up on looking for
    new gun sites, so we were now headed toward our truck. Dillon and Kraft were
    up ahead of Grimes and me. Grimes grabbed my arm to slow me down and allow
    the other two to get out of hearing range. Grimes was a big talker, but he
    had been unusually quiet on this trip. He turned to me and said,
    "Someone ought to shoot that dumb sonofabitch," as he nodded
    toward Kraft. He then itemized the things that Kraft had done that evening.
    "First, that a-h--- takes us on a reconnaissance in a truck loaded with
    ammunition, then he wants us to put our gun in a spot where we would be shot
    before we could dig the first shovelful of dirt for a gun pit, and then he
    forgets the password and almost gets us all killed by our own men."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">He caught me completely by surprise. Although
    I knew he was impetuous, I did not expect this from him. I also wondered
    whom he meant by "someone." Certainly, he wasn't talking about us.
    Or was he? We were getting near to our truck so I did not say anything back
    to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We reached the truck and boarded it. As we
    did, a garage door opened across the street from where we were parked, and a
    small civilian car pulled out. It was one of the few operating civilian cars
    we had seen since arriving in Europe, and I was surprised at how
    small-really small-it was compared to American cars. It was my first look at
    a Volkswagen (peoples car) Beetle. One of the engineering GIs on the street
    told us it was a doctor on his way to deliver a baby. It seemed so out of
    place for what was going on around us. The doctor, who was elderly, had
    opened the garage door, pulled the car out and then had gone back to close
    the door. His car was blocking the narrow street, so we had to wait for him
    to move out of the way before we could turn the truck around. The garage
    door was stuck, and he was having a hard time getting it closed. As he
    labored with it, half a dozen GIs just stood there unwilling to offer him a
    hand. I guess, at this phase of the war all Germans were the enemy to these
    men, and they were not even going to help an old doctor on a mission of
    mercy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It took Grimes a half-dozen moves to turn the
    truck around on the narrow street. Heerstrasse, including the sidewalks on
    both sides, was only marginally wider than the length of the truck, and he
    came close to hitting the tavern window as he turned around. Normally, he
    would have gone up to the first intersection to turn around but that street
    could be seen from across the river. Grimes was making so much noise
    grinding the gears while shifting that we drew a lot of stares from the
    gathering crowd of GIs. There was a lot of activity among them as they
    headed along the street to their new locations. At first, we thought they
    had come out of the buildings to watch us but we soon saw they had more
    serious matters on their minds. They were preparing for the big shooting
    match they were going to put on for the Germans. I remembered what the major
    in the CP had said earlier in the evening about the sham crossing. Above
    all, I was thinking about him saying he did not think that the Germans had
    any tanks over in St. Goarshausen. I sure hoped he was right. If there were
    tanks there, they could take direct aim at us on our trip up the hill. There
    were no armored vehicles or artillery pieces visible to us on our side of
    the river to return fire if they did.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I looked at my watch with its radium dial.
    The time was approaching 2300 hours.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we finally got headed in the right
    direction down Heerstrasse, Grimes had to drive slowly to keep from hitting
    the many GIs. There were now a half-dozen mortar crews set up on the
    sidewalk farthest from the river and several of them were stacking their
    shells against the adjoining buildings. Other men were walking along
    carrying outboard motors, machine guns, boxes of ammunition; and all of them
    had M-1 rifles slung up over their shoulders. We finally turned and headed
    up the hill. Dillon and I were dreading the trip. We had not gone a hundred
    feet up the steep incline when the truck stopped, and Grimes again ground
    the gear teeth as he downshifted into a lower-probably the lowest-gear. We
    knew that the lower the gear, the slower our speed would be all the way to
    the top of the hill. Finally, we were moving at about a two-mile-per-hour
    pace. It was going to be a long journey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had gone another short distance when the
    firing started. The Americans opened up with 20mm's, machine guns, mortars,
    and small arms fire. Immediately, the Germans started firing back. That
    answered our question about whether they were still over there. Suddenly,
    there were some very loud explosions in St. Goar that really got our
    attention. German artillery that sounded like it was coming from out of the
    valley joined in the exchange. There were now flashes of light coming up
    from some of the locations being hit. Ordinarily, the machine guns would use
    tracers to see where they were firing, but in this situation, they did not
    want to give out their positions. However, occasionally a single tracer
    would show up coming from the other side of the river.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The GIs had about a dozen outboard engines
    running at what sounded like full throttle to give the impression they were
    coming across in motor-propelled assault boats. The noise was intense and
    was accentuated as it reverberated off the walls of the gorge. The German
    artillery shells exploding in St. Goar were especially noisy, and we were
    very nervous about the situation. Most of them hit down near the buildings
    facing the water, but several of them hit up higher on the sloping ground
    and we heard the shrapnel from several of them tear through nearby trees.
    That noise created a more intense fear as it gave the impression we were
    being fired on directly. Maybe we were. I for one wished we could dive into
    a nearby ditch to take cover.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Dillon and I got out of the truck for awhile
    and walked about fifty feet behind it, although I do not think that would
    have been far enough if it exploded from a hit with all of those munitions
    on board. We thought for sure we were in the crosshairs of some German
    gunner. The truck was going so slowly we had no trouble keeping up with it,
    but finally we tired from climbing the steep grade. With the truck moving
    and the tailgate up, it took several tries and all of our strength to scale
    the top of the tailgate, which was about six feet off the pavement. I gave
    Dillon a boost on board and then he helped me on. There, we sat and
    watched-actually, it was more listening to-the action out the back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Dillon was sitting on some empty sandbags. He
    looked over at me where I was sitting on a box of ammunition and said,
    "If we get hit, Gallagher, you're going to get a 40mm shell right up
    your ass."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I responded, "You aren't going to look
    so great, either. They can bury what's left of you in one of those sandbags
    you're sitting on and there will be plenty of room left over." While
    this type of bantering was usually done with smiles, the situation was too
    tense for any levity. We were like the proverbial jittery guys whistling
    past the graveyard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After the initial exchange of fire died down,
    there was less noise but still a lot of rounds crossed the river from both
    sides, mostly small arms fire with an occasional burst of a machine gun. We
    could differentiate by the sound which side of the river the machine gun
    fire was coming from. The German guns fired at a much higher rate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I was still thinking about what Grimes had
    said about Kraft, and I wondered if Dillon and I would see at any moment
    Kraft come flying out of the side of the truck cab with Grime's foot on his
    backside. Fortunately, nothing like that happened, and I finally concluded
    that Grimes was just blowing smoke. Any way you figure, Kraft was safe.
    Grimes and I never discussed the matter again, and I never said anything to
    anyone else about it. Actually, the expression, "I'm going to kill
    him," or, in this case, "Someone ought to kill him," is heard
    quite often in the military services but it is seldom meant and implemented
    even less. These statements or the actual deed that would follow are seldom
    written or talked about for obvious reasons. With no records to go by,
    actual figures are impossible to determine but it is generally agreed that
    the final deed is rare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were getting near the top of the hill when
    our truck veered to the right in an evasive move to avoid hitting a Jeep
    traveling at a very high rate of speed in the opposite direction without
    lights. There were four people in it, all wearing helmets, but we did not
    get a good look at them because they went by at a reckless speed. It soon
    rounded a corner on the winding road, and we lost track of it. It was to be
    the only moving vehicle other than the German doctor's car we saw on the
    whole trip. A short time after the Jeep passed, there was a big explosion on
    or near the road, approximately where we figured the Jeep would have been.
    Flames shot up for a few seconds and then there was nothing. Was it the
    Jeep? If it was, did it crash or did an enemy shell hit it? If it was hit,
    why didn't the Germans fire at us, a much larger target? Several days later,
    we heard a rumor (which later proved false) the American crossing of the
    Rhine River at St. Goar was being delayed because the colonel in charge of
    the operation in that area had been killed during the preparations. At the
    time, we wondered if he was in the Jeep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We finally reached level ground, and the
    truck went into high gear. It felt good to put distance between the river
    and us. When we got back to the bivouac area, we dropped Kraft off at a tent
    being used as the battery CP. We went back to our crew to give them the bad
    news about the location of their next gun emplacement. We started referring
    to it as the suicide mission. When we told them where we had been, several
    of them did not believe us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We told other gun sections about what Kraft
    had said, and they kept asking us, "Are you sure he said tonight?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Nobody in our crew slept much that night with the threat of moving down into
    the valley to dig gun positions hanging over us. The next morning there was
    a big sigh of relief from all of us because we did not move up during the
    night like Kraft told us we would.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">During the night, Dillon asked me, "Did
    it ever occur to you that the idea of going down into the town last evening
    to look for gun positions may have been Mc Kee's idea and not Kraft's?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Never thought of it," I replied,
    "but it does make sense. Kraft wouldn't take on that much authority on
    his own."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Sure, I'll bet the whole thing was
    planned by ole bandy legs himself," he said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Well, whoever it was, it was a bad idea
    to start with and Kraft made it even worse by not realizing sooner that we
    should not have been down there when we went into that CP," said I.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Just be glad that you aren't in an
    infantry unit with those two guys leading you." Dillon said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Early the next morning, we convinced Dillon,
    as our crew's ranking noncom, to go to the CP and find out what was going
    on. We worried the only thing worse than going down into the valley during
    the night was to go in the daytime when visibility was better. While doing
    that did not make a lot of sense, neither did Kraft's original idea. Dillon
    went, and came back a few minutes later with a big smile on his face. It
    turned out there was a change in plans, or at least in Kraft's plan.
    Somebody higher in command had decided nobody in our outfit was going down
    into St. Goar until the Germans were out of St. Goarshausen. We were to move
    up that night after dark and dig in on the flat area near the rim where the
    land dropped off. There were smiles all around.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Moving Up To The Rhine River</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At about 1900 hours on Sunday evening, March
    25th, we moved up in convoy on the same road we had been on the night
    before, through the forest, across the open area, and up close to the rim.
    We turned right and drove through open fields, parallel to the river. Gun
    sections were dropped out of convoy to establish gun positions along the
    way. Our truck pulling the 40mm gun stopped about a mile from the road. It
    was right next to the only other road into St. Goar. The M-51 mount
    continued across the road and stopped there for their final location. Our
    two gun crews were about one hundred and fifty feet apart and both units
    were a hundred feet from the rim. We disconnected the guns from their
    respective trucks and unloaded the sandbags and long-handled shovels. The
    large safety pins were pulled from the 40mm gun, the outriggers extended,
    and the gun dropped down onto its leveling pads. It was set up next to the
    location for the new pit and was ready to fire from this temporary site if
    necessary. The trucks were parked in a low area behind some trees, well back
    from the rim in an area where we planned to set our two tents after the gun
    pits were completed. It could not be seen from across the river.
    Immediately, everyone began digging the gun pits. We wanted to be
    operational and behind sand bags as soon as possible because we were
    concerned about German artillery on the bluff above St. Goarshausen. Their
    spotters could locate our gun positions from that elevation, and we wanted
    to have a place to take cover in case they decided to make us a target.
    Grimes, Dillon, and I had not forgotten the exciting exchange of fire of the
    night before. The moon was bright-too bright for our liking-and we were able
    to clearly see across the river. From our position, we could see only about
    half the main section of St. Goarshausen that was farthest from the river,
    but we could see the entire sloping bank that led down to it. There were
    some houses on the slope but, like the town itself, there was no sign of
    life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Across the river, we could also see a castle
    almost directly in line with us. It was built in the fourteenth century and
    was called the Burgen Katz (Cat, Castle). The Counts of Katzeneinbogen built
    it. Far off to our left, also overlooking St. Goarshausen was the Burgen
    Maus (Mouse, Castle) built by the Archbishop of Trent. (This castle is
    mentioned in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, The Children's Hour.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Off to our right, the river made a sharp
    bend. It was the only place we could see the river directly when we looked
    out from our gun pit. On the opposite bank of the river at this bend was a
    steep cliff. The site was known for the echo produced there and, of more
    significance, the extreme difficulty boats had navigating the river around
    the bend. It inspired German writer Clemens Brentano to create the legend of
    a beautiful young maiden named Lorelei, who threw herself headlong into the
    river in despair over a faithless lover. According to the legend, she was
    transformed into a siren upon her death and could be heard from that time on
    singing as she sat on the rock, enticing mariners to their death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The road next to our gun position was
    depressed about six feet below the land adjacent to it. On many occasions,
    we would go down on this road and up to the rim to see what was going on
    down by the river.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In this part of Germany, the Rhine River
    flows on an irregular path from the southeast toward the northwest (See Fig.
    92). Germany's greatest river, it was the last major bastion of the German
    defense against the Allied armies. Nobody expected they would surrender its
    crossing without a bitter battle.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="St. Goar Map" src ="images/Map_St_Goar_Area_18_92.jpg" width=600 height=792 ></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After we had been digging for several hours,
    we heard the thunderous discharge of the big 155mm artillery pieces from
    back behind the forest, where we had been bivouacked before moving into gun
    positions. Even at seven or eight miles away, the guns sounded impressive.
    There would be sharp noises like claps of thunder followed by a rumbling
    noise. We were not prepared for what happened next. Seconds after the
    discharge, a light, shrill sound quickly grew to an unbelievable loud pitch
    as the screaming projectile from the guns passed over our heads on their way
    to the town across the river. We were sure each one was headed straight for
    us. It was terribly frightening. We dropped to the ground or jumped into
    what had been built of the gun pit when the first volleys came in. The
    barrage kept up for about an hour.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We figured there were eight guns, which would
    fire in a battery of four, one right after the other. After about a
    thirty-second delay, the other four would fire. This sequence would be
    repeated about every five minutes. Finally, we could stand up and just pull
    our heads down a little as the projectiles arched overhead. As the first
    shells approached after each pause between firings, we would look at each
    other to see if someone was going to break and dive to the ground. It would
    have been the prudent thing to do, but nobody wanted to be the first to make
    a move, so we all just stood our ground. We figured in order to reach the
    bottom of the valley where the target was, the shells would have to just
    clear the rim near us on their downward trajectory. They were not very high
    above us when they passed overhead. When the shells hit St. Goarshausen,
    they sounded like a large airplane hangar door being slammed. Light flashes
    would come up out of the river valley with some of the hits. No one wanted
    to be on the receiving end of one of them. We prayed they would not fall
    short.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Meanwhile, the Germans were lobbing shells
    into St. Goar, but from the sound at impact, the shells were much smaller
    than the Americans'. We could not tell if theirs were mortars or artillery.
    Mortars would be fired from up close, and make little noise at discharge.
    Artillery could be fired from many miles away, and it also produced little
    sound because of the distance. There was nothing falling on the rim where we
    and the others in our battalion were located. There was more firing down
    near the river but we were unable to determine its significance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We continued to dig in with a new sense of
    urgency created by the artillery duel. The thought of having a gun pit for
    protection propelled us to get the job done as soon as possible. We debated
    digging foxholes away from the gun in case we were fired on by artillery.
    That idea was abandoned because we decided it would delay the completion of
    the gun pit, which would offer protection enough. We did, however, decide to
    place an extra layer of sandbags across the front of our pit facing the
    river.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we first arrived at this site one of our
    crewmembers, Le Claire, had injured himself. He had been standing on some
    equipment with his head sticking out the top of the truck. As the truck
    passed under a tree, he was looking toward the back, and a low-hanging
    branch hit him. He was knocked out for about fifteen minutes, and we had
    quite a time trying to revive him. When he finally came to, he was
    disoriented, so we had Grimes drive him back to headquarters to be checked
    by a medic. Grimes had dropped him off and then returned to help us dig in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the pit was almost completed, a Jeep
    showed up delivering Le Claire. He was feeling better and wanted to rejoin
    our crew. Also in the Jeep were Lieutenant Engler, Sergeant Kornich, and
    Corporal Sophie, the driver. Engler and Kornich, who were in charge of our
    platoon, were the best liked lieutenant and sergeant in our outfit. Sophie
    was the butt of a lot of jokes. He was known to be scared to death of the
    whole war experience, and it showed on his face. He always looked like he
    was having a panic attack and was subjected to a lot of teasing because of
    it. At one of our previous locations, a couple of sergeants told him to go
    out behind the building where they were billeted and take care of the two
    German soldiers who were there in the yard. They explained to him that,
    "They are well dug-in so be careful." Trembling badly, Sophie had
    gone out to find two graves with the rifles and helmets of German soldiers
    atop them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All three men got out of the Jeep and stood
    around the pit, talking to us. Some small arms fire was coming up out of the
    valley but the 155s had been silent for a while. The crew was doing what we
    did best. We were complaining about the food rations we had now been on for
    about a week and were asking when we were going to get some real chow. The
    answer was, "Soon." The battery field kitchen was being set up
    back in the bivouac area, and they had located a supply depot. They had
    picked up some 10-in-1 rations and hoped to deliver cooked food by truck the
    next day. Our griping about the food had another purpose other than the
    obvious one of trying to get better food. We had learned if we complained
    about something first, it seemed to reduce the amount of things that Engler
    and Kornich would find wrong with what we were doing at our gun site.<br>
    While they were there, we pulled the 40mm back up onto its wheels, pushed it
    into the newly dug pit, and dropped it down onto its leveling pads. There
    was still more work to be done with the sandbags.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kornich explained to Crow where the next gun
    section was so he could string the telephone wire to it. It was just over a
    small rise, out of sight to us, about a block away. Crow and Hughes decided
    to lay the wire immediately, primarily because they felt it would be safer
    at night than in daylight. The moon was bright enough to see where they were
    going and the route between sites was all over open fields. They took off
    with their reel of wire. There was nothing between our position and their
    destination that would warrant exploration so we knew they would be back in
    a hurry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after they left, while the rest of us
    were still working on the pit, the 155's went off again - one, two, three,
    and four. The crew knew what was going to happen next, but our guests
    didn't. As the projectiles neared our position and the shrill noise got
    louder, the crewmembers just stood there. The shells whistled low over our
    heads, and we clenched our teeth in an effort to control our emotions.
    Engler and Kornich fell flat on the ground with only the front rim of their
    helmets keeping their faces out of the earth. Sophie dove into the pit and
    hurt his arm when he hit one of the gun's outriggers. He let out a cry that
    could have been heard a mile away. The rest of us had intended our unplanned
    attempt to embarrass the others to be a joke but it backfired because Sophie
    was hurt. Also, because we liked Engler and Kornich more than the others of
    their rank, it did not seem right to make them scapegoats whether it was
    planned or not. There was no way for those who had cowered to recover
    gracefully. They just got up, brushed off their uniforms, walked to their
    Jeep, and drove off with Kornich doing the driving. Sophie was either too
    badly hurt or too scared to do so. Dillon asked, "Who the hell's idea
    was that anyhow?" We took it to be a rhetorical question, and nobody
    answered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Unbeknownst to us, the 89th Infantry Division
    was putting into motion the final plans for the crossing at St.Goar that
    night.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Company "C" of the 168th
    Engineering Combat Battalion (part of the 89th) drew the equipment for the
    crossing at the bridge dump. It consisted of fifty-five M2 assault boats,
    four 22-horsepower outboard motor boats, and four storm boats. This
    equipment was transported to an assembly area to the rear of the crossing
    site. At 2100 hours it was moved to the crossing site and unloaded behind
    the buildings facing the river. Thirty-six assault boats that were propelled
    by small paddles were set out to transport the first wave. The balance was
    held under cover and motors mounted. The storm boats were unloaded and
    prepared for launching. By 2300 hours, preparations at the site were
    completed.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By midnight, the infantry riflemen of the two
    assault regiments from the 354th Regiment were tramping silently down the
    steep road to their positions on the riverbank. For hours, the Division's
    105s and 155s had been pounding known and suspected targets on the far side,
    but now the barrage was stilled and an uneasy quiet settled over the gorge.
    In total blackout the engineers, trucks carrying pontoons, treadways, and
    assault boats crept bumper to bumper down the narrow twisting roads. MPs of
    the 89th Military Police Platoon unsnarled traffic and kept the convoy
    moving.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After the gun pit was completed, Joe Bernal,
    Wellington, and I went back away from the gorge to the low area where we
    were to going to pitch our tents. The noise had picked up down in the
    valley. The gun pit was far enough along where it could easily be finished
    by the remaining men by daybreak. Trying to make some light conversation
    during a tense time, I asked Joe Bernal, "Hey Joe, what are you doing
    without your daily letter from your girl friend?" He had a heavy
    romance going with this girl from his back of the yards neighborhood in
    Chicago before he entered service and she wrote him almost on a daily basis.
    I had heard so much about her when we shared a pup tent on the Mojave Desert
    in the States, I felt as if I knew her. He had left out none of the details.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">He responded, "I'm not doing so well,
    and if we don't get back to the States pretty soon, I may be getting a Dear
    John letter like Grimes. She said in the last one that she was starting to
    go to dances at the USO in downtown Chicago. She assured me that there was
    nothing to worry about, but that's what has me worried."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I could see he was really concerned about this girl so I let the subject
    drop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We unloaded the tent from the truck, carried
    it over to the hollow, and spread it out on the ground. We were manipulating
    the center pole to raise it when suddenly the noise down in the valley
    picked up dramatically. It was many times louder than anything we had heard
    before, and it was obvious something big was happening. The sound was
    deafening. Soon after, the valley lit up like someone had turned on massive
    floodlights. We could see heavy smoke coming from down there, and we
    realized there was a major fire in progress. What could be burning that made
    things so bright? It was a real mystery to us. This was a new and unknown
    factor that increased our nervousness. With the valley lit up like that, any
    attempt at a surprise crossing would be lost and every boat would be an
    easily identifiable target. The fire burned itself out in time but the
    damage to the crossing operation had been done.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
        Germans had pumped tracers into a gasoline-soaked barge anchored off the 
        shore of St. Goarshausen and flames floodlighted the gorge from shore to 
        shore. All semblances of surprise and concealment had been lost. By this 
        time, smoke from the burning buildings, many fired by the heavy Division 
        artillery concentration earlier, along with the burning barge, forced a 
        pall over the river.<sup 
      >8</sup></font></p></blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      dropped the pole and all three of us raced back to the gun pit. At the 
      pit, everyone looked tense and alert. "What's going on?" I 
      asked.</font></p>

burning."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 
      addition to machine gun, mortar, and small arms fire, there were larger 
      explosions than we had ever heard going on in the valley. The American 
      artillery had gone quiet but the Germans were throwing heavy shells into 
      St. Goar. While none of it was landing up in our area, we realized 
      spending time in the gun pit might be a good idea.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
        guide patrol embarked at 0130 (the next morning) under extremely heavy 
        fire. The patrol was forced back, and consequently no guide lights were 
        placed. The platoon of engineer reinforcements requested at 0100 had not 
        arrived by 0200, and the main assault got underway with only twenty-nine 
        boats. At the embarkation, heavy small arms fire, machine guns, 20 mm 
        flak guns, and 88 mm artillery were received from the German side and it 
        continued throughout the crossing. Assault boats were riddled with 
        holes, and many men were killed or wounded. Some boats never made it 
        across, and they were swept downstream. The engineers manning the oars 
        paddled like mad, and the riflemen crouched low in the boats (See Fig. 
        93). The survivors who made the crossing intact floundered ashore and 
        advanced into St. Goarshausen where they met even heavier resistance. No 
        boats or crews returned from the initial wave. It was later determined 
        that the engineer crews fought as infantry when they determined that 
        their boats were unserviceable and not fit to return.<sup

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      was a considerable amount of white smoke coming up from the town of St.

      to cover their operation, possibly from both.</font></p>

      hour or so before dawn, we heard the roar of mighty engines and 
      unmistakable noise of clanking armored vehicles moving in around us up on 
      the rim. We could see the moon reflecting off metal and hear the crews 
      shouting what sounded like commands. Sometimes, the only indicator of a 
      vehicle was the blue flame flaring out of its exhaust. It was an eerie 
      feeling knowing a major armored vehicle operation was taking place right 
      next to us, yet not being able to determine exactly what they were up to. 
      Later, it became obvious they were getting into positions to fire at 
      targets across the river. We kept our flashlights handy as they maneuvered 
      around getting into position. Although there was moonlight, we knew tanks 
      had limited visibility, and we did not want them to roll right over our 
      gun pit. One of the vehicles roared within ten feet of our pit, and its 
      track crushed one of our water cans. "Watch where you're going, you dumb 
      bastard" yelled Dillon, but his voice was lost in the roar of the 
      engine.</font></p>

      >The Third Army Shows the Might of Its 
      Armor</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      dawn broke the next morning, we saw an amazing sight. There were tanks and 
      tank destroyers lined up along the rim, about one hundred feet apart, for 
      the entire length of the town down in the valley. There were about twelve 
      to our right and they extended as far to our left as we could see. Some 
      were up close to the rim while others were farther back. We had seen some 
      of the Third Army's armored might before, but never anything of this 
      magnitude. The sight was almost surreal, with the morning ground fog 
      hiding the vehicles tracks and their turrets and cannons protruding 
      through looking like a sea of turtles. It was as if some large 
      fortification like the Maginot or Siegfried Lines had been built overnight 
      along the ridge.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">But, 
      this was no defensive fortification. This show of armored might was there 
      to bombard the Germans over in St. Goarshausen with heavy firepower. They 
      were there to drive them out of the town across the river, then follow 
      them deeper into Germany doing the same thing again and again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Shortly after dawn, Thomas, Grimes and I went down 
      onto the nearby road and walked up to the rim to watch the action on the 
      river with binoculars (See Fig. 95). It was much clearer down there where 
      there was no ground fog.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Over 
      in St. Goarshausen, the men of the 89th were fighting house to 
      house.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Right 
      after we arrived at the rim, ambulances began coming up from the valley 
      heading inland from the river, and we had to get out of the way to let 
      them pass. They must have gone down on the other road leading into St. 
      Goar because we did not see them going in. The large prominently painted 
      Red Cross stood out on the bleak OD color of these vehicles as somber 
      reminders of what they were carrying. They represented the end of life, 
      permanent injuries, or, at best, the beginning of painful recovery for 
      their occupants. The drivers looked tense.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Down 
      in the gorge, a major operation was going on and there were remnants of 
      battles that had taken place during the night.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Across the river in St. Goarshausen we saw empty 
      assault boats on the shore. Several dozen captured Germans were sitting 
      near the water line guarded by GIs standing back near the buildings facing 
      the river for shelter. About a hundred feet away, again close to the 
      buildings, medics attended the wounded. What appeared to be bodies were 
      lined up in a row a short distance away. Inland, there were GIs from the 
      89th Infantry Battalion fighting from house to house to take control of 
      the town. It was not easy going as the Germans were putting up 
      considerable resistance. Part of the firing from the Germans was coming 
      from higher elevations, which made the GIs movements more difficult. The 
      firing was heavy from both sides but it appeared the Germans were the only 
      ones using artillery. The question was, where was our artillery? The smoke 
      coming up from behind buildings facing the river was positively identified 
      as a smoke screen laid down to conceal the movement of our 
      infantry.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Out 
      on the river more boats were making the crossing and the men in them were 
      huddled low trying to avoid the direct fire from across the river. They 
      were taking hits, and it was horrible to see men slump down in their boats 
      after getting shot. Several boats sustained heavier casualties than the 
      others, and one was drifting downstream.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On 
      the St. Goar side, boats and troops were crowded along Heerstrasse, one 
      block inland from the river (See Fig. 96). They were being readied to make 
      the dash down to the river to make additional crossings. One of the key 
      battles of World War II, the crossing of the Rhine River, was developing 
      before us and we had a bird's-eye view of it. All the players were in 
      place. The engineers, infantry, armor, and artillery were all performing 
      as assigned. The excitement was something that could never be duplicated 
      and we would remember forever. While the scene included death and 
      destruction, there was a wondrous feeling about the overall magnitude of 
      the picture. It was overwhelming to the senses, which registered many 
      emotions. The strongest was the horror of watching young men die, 
      especially those dressed like us.<br></font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      watching for about twenty minutes, we returned to our gun pit. There, we 
      checked out the status of the armor that arrived last night, watched the 
      sky for enemy aircraft, and ate cold C-rations for breakfast. The whole 
      gun crew was at the pit, as it was no time for sleep or any other 
      activity. We looked across the river and speculated what was going on over 
      there. What were those Krauts up to? Did they have to shave every day like 
      we did? What were they eating for breakfast? Or, were they concentrating 
      on more important matters like fighting for their lives against the 
      invading American infantry? We were becoming a lot less worried about 
      their artillery spotters watching us with binoculars and setting our 
      coordinates.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As 
      the sun became stronger in the sky, the ground fog faded fast and we got a 
      full view of our new neighbors in their armored vehicles. Their closeness 
      made their size even more impressive, and their number had our crewmembers 
      agape. Sitting there in the open fields, the armor contrasted with the 
      serene setting of the postcard-like landscape. They seemed out of place, 
      even in wartime, in the land of meadows, valleys, and a picturesque river. 
      We still had not had a good view of any of their crews. They were lying 
      low, not knowing what kind of fire they were going to get from the other 
      side of the river. Finally, a head covered with a steel helmet would pop 
      up, here and there, to check out the other side of the river. The weather 
      was now becoming clear and sunny with unlimited visibility. Crow commented 
      over the phone from the M-51 mount to our 40mm gun pit, Southern accent 
      dripping in sarcasm, "What a day for a turkey shoot."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Setting about thirty feet from us was one of the 
      Army's latest tank destroyers (TDs). It was considerably larger than other 
      American tanks like the Shermans we had seen in such abundance through out 
      Europe. Other than the size, the main difference between a tank and a tank 
      destroyer was the top of the turret was open on the tank destroyer. The 
      one next to us was the new M36 model (See Fig. 97), the most powerful 
      American antitank weapon of World War II. It had a high velocity 90mm gun 
      instead of the 75mm most American tanks and tank destroyers had. It was 
      designed to compete with the 88mm gun the Germans used in their Panzer 
      (Armored) Divisions and was now ending the reign of that weapon. Tank 
      destroyers in general played a vital role in the battle for 
      Europe.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="M-36 Tank Destoyer" src="images/M-36_Tank_Destroyer_18_97.jpg" width="600" height="425" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Until 
      the 90mm came along, battle records showed it took up to four American 
      tanks like the Sherman (32-tons with a 75mm cannon) to match one German 
      Tiger tank (56-tons with an 88mm cannon) with its heavier armor and 
      greater firepower.10 The American tanks made up for their deficiencies 
      somewhat by their superior numbers and greater maneuverability. However, 
      on a straight head-to-head confrontation, the Tiger and its high-velocity 
      armor-piercing 88mm gun won every time against the Sherman.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      tank destroyers in this operation up on the rim were part of the 602nd 
      Tank Destroyer Battalion. The crewmen wore steel helmets instead of the 
      leather crash helmets other tank crewmen had worn. Their slogan of 
      "Seek-Strike-Destroy" was a strong indicator of their aggressive attitude 
      toward the enemy.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      were also tanks and tank destroyers that had gone down into the town of 
      St. Goar during the night. They were now in position at that location to 
      fire across the river at the enemy (See Figs. 98 and 99).</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="US Tank in St. Goar - World War II" src="images/Tank_18_98.jpg" width="496" height="432" ></p>

      <p><img border="0" alt="M18 Hellcat Tank Destroyer - World War II" src="images/Tank_Destroyer_St_Goar_18_99.jpg" width="600" height="564" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      tank and tank destroyer commanders on the rim near us were in radio 
      contact with one another. We knew they were going to fire soon, so we 
      asked the M36 commander who had the rank of staff sergeant to move further 
      away. We had been around 90mm antiaircraft guns when they went off, and 
      the noise would shake you down to your toes. He told us he had orders to 
      be right where he was, and he wasn't going to move.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At 
      about 0800 hours, they all opened up, hurling their high-explosive shells 
      at targets across the river. The vehicle near us roared, flames poured out 
      of the muzzle, smoke engulfed the barrel, and the large brass shell casing 
      came flying out the back of the vehicle. The deafening sound blasted our 
      eardrums. One powerful explosion followed another. The mighty shells of 
      destruction screamed across the river with a special kind of rage. The 
      tank destroyer jolted and lurched backward at each shot. It was a very 
      impressive war machine, threatening and menacing built to destroy anything 
      it hit and to drive the enemy from his position. Most of our crewmembers 
      stood in awe with their mouths open, glad it was on our side. We marveled 
      at such power, and we knew we were watching a real killing 
      machine.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Between shots the loader slammed a new shell into the 
      firing chamber. The vehicle made a whirring noise as the barrel was moved 
      to take on a new target or to adjust for a second shot at what they had 
      missed. Between rounds, we could hear the TDs engine throbbing when noise 
      from other guns in the area didn't drown it out. The commander was now 
      standing in the open turret, bracing himself against the side, directing 
      the fire while looking through field glasses. After observing each shot 
      the commander yelled out either, "Take that, you son of a bitch!" or just 
      plain, "Son of a bitch!" depending on whether he had a hit or a miss. The 
      armored vehicles were quiet only for the period of time it took to reload 
      and set a new target.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      vehicles generated thick smoke and an overpowering smell of gunpowder. It 
      penetrated our nostrils and made us choke. We kept a special watch on the 
      M36 tank destroyer near us in an effort to determine when it was going to 
      fire next because it was less startling if you knew when the discharge was 
      going to happen. The noise rattled our nervous systems, chattered our 
      teeth and blasted our ears. We opened our mouths and yelled, and we put 
      our fingers in our ears, which helped only a little. It may have been 
      because we were in a gun pit the percussion seemed so loud. Stevens could 
      not take the noise and moved back toward the forest to get away from it. 
      The noise did not seem to affect the tank destroyer's crew nearly as much 
      as it did us. Either they were used to it, or they had some kind of 
      earplugs muffling the noise.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      tanks down in the town were firing, and they made a womp, womp kind of 
      sound which was louder than anything we had heard from down there before. 
      The small arms and machinegun fire going across seemed insignificant but 
      certainly they were not insignificant to the people on the receiving 
      end.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      the tank destroyer near us made a direct hit, the crew would let out a 
      cheer we took to mean they were celebrating the accuracy of their gunnery, 
      not the act of destroying the enemy. Could there possibly be a positive 
      emotion in killing someone, even your wartime adversary? Or, was the 
      excitement of the hunt so great its culmination in hitting a target 
      produced a feeling of joy? Was the feeling some form of revenge for 
      something that had happened earlier in the war? Did the fact they were 
      some distance from the target have anything to do with it? Certainly, a 
      bomber crew had less feelings about dropping a load of bombs on a 
      heavily-populated city from fifteen thousand feet than an infantry man did 
      in shooting a lone enemy soldier up close and watching the expression on 
      his face before he fell.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      majority of the American Army and probably the armies of most countries 
      were draftees during major wars, and, therefore, most were reluctant 
      warriors. What then made them ready to participate in killing other men 
      and cheering when they succeeded? When and why did they learn to enjoy it? 
      Perhaps they got caught up in the contest of winning or losing, and it 
      became a matter of winning at all cost. Soldiers soon learned the options 
      for the losers were being killed, wounded, captured or retreating in 
      shame, none of which were desirable alternatives. I am not of the opinion 
      expressed by some historians that war destroys the last vestiges of human 
      dignity and substitutes a killer instinct void of a conscience. Perhaps 
      this happens to a few, but not the majority of soldiers.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">My 
      feeling is this appearance of enjoyment shown by the tankers near our gun 
      pit was really a release of emotion driven by a rush of adrenaline that 
      can be misconstrued as a show of pleasure. From my own experience, I 
      learned there is nothing that makes the heart pound harder than hearing a 
      large gun going off near you.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      tank destroyer commander next to us was a very self-assured individual, 
      bordering on being cocksure, which, from my limited observation, seemed to 
      be a characteristic of many of the men who had that job. It undoubtedly 
      came from having full control over a juggernaut of a vehicle capable of 
      creating terror at first sight in the enemy then following through and 
      turning that visual terror into total destruction. This sergeant in his 
      souped-up, top-of-the-line tank destroyer had it. His bravado came from 
      knowing he had a cannon bigger than other American TDs, a well-trained 
      crew, a powerful engine, heavier armor plate, excellent maneuverability, 
      the latest sighting system, and great speed. When you looked good, you 
      felt good and you knew it. Men who feel sure their equipment, crew, and 
      they themselves were better than their enemies made the best tank 
      commanders, and the feeling of cockiness came naturally. It was a normal 
      emotion.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      sergeant in command of the tank destroyer next to our pit and all the 
      other ones were directing their fire at specific houses. After about 
      fifteen minutes of firing, I watched through binoculars as men I assumed 
      to be German soldiers ran between the houses away from the 
      river.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      commander looked over at us and said, "Watch the (Cat) castle." He had 
      gotten word by radio that the Germans were using one of the windows of the 
      castle about halfway up the wall facing us as an observation site. The 
      tank destroyer fired one shell, which hit just below the window knocking a 
      hole in the wall despite its ample thickness. "Son of a bitch!" he yelled. 
      The next shell went right into the window and exploded inside. Again, it 
      was, "Take that, you son of a bitch!"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      action continued throughout the morning when it let up but did not stop. 
      We kept getting updates on what was happening down in the valley from one 
      of our gun sections that had a better view of the river. They reported 
      additional troops were going across.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
        >Shortly after 1100, Company G, the 2nd Battalion's 
        reserve, shoved off for St. Goarshausen with the 2nd Platoon in the 
        lead. Although the Germans had been eliminated from most of the town, 
        they still held the heights and cut loose with a furious barrage.<sup 
        >11</sup></font></p></blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Late 
      in the morning, some of the Germans up on the slope behind the town must 
      have decided they'd had enough, and started to pull out of their 
      positions. The GIs were also flushing the Jerries out of basements in the 
      town and starting to take over the village proper. More prisoners were 
      being taken. They were being sent down to the river's edge to a temporary 
      holding spot. The battle was becoming one sided. Again, several of us 
      walked to the edge to watch the action with binoculars. From what we could 
      see, there appeared to be only one road out of the town. The Germans 
      located higher up were leaving on foot, in one truck, and in their version 
      of the Jeep. They made perfect targets for the GI gunners. I watched a 
      Jeep like vehicle pull out on the road with about eight men hanging on 
      like flies. It immediately took a direct hit, and none of the occupants 
      moved after that. The truck got almost to the rim where it, too, was hit. 
      The cargo area was covered so I don't know what was in it. Those German 
      soldiers who were leaving on foot seemed to be faring better than the 
      vehicles. They were running from house to house instead of staying on the 
      road, sometimes being chased by machine gun tracers from our side. It was 
      pandemonium, and the Germans were taking heavy casualties. I did not see 
      anybody make it to</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Lorelei Bend Smoke Screen" vspace="8" src="images/Lorelei_bend_smoke_screen_18_100.jpg" width="400" align="right" height="264" ><font size="3" 
      face=Arial> the top, but others in our crew said some 
      did. There was still some firing coming from someplace on the Lorelei 
      cliff and the Americans were throwing in a smoke screen to hide their 
      assault on it. (See Fig. 100). The GIs in St. Goarshausen were moving 
      cautiously as they were still under fire from higher 
elevations.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      armored vehicles near us on the rim ran out of targets, so they cranked up 
      and began pulling back along with the other armored vehicles along the 
      rim. We could not determine if they were going down into St.Goar or to 
      another location. They left hundreds of spent shell casings and empty 
      packing tubes scattered behind. My ears were still ringing from the roar 
      of the 90mm gun. Stevens had returned to the pit, and he was slapping one 
      of his ears with the palm of his hand in a futile effort to bring his 
      hearing back to normal.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      learned later that a few of the 40mm guns from Battery A of our battalion 
      had been firing shells across the river at German 20mm crews holed up in 
      caves on the other side. We wondered why we were not also called on to 
      fire.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b 
      >Not So Friendly Fire</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 
      the early afternoon, there were infrequent rounds being fired, but it 
      seemed calm compared to what we had been experiencing. The sun was out, 
      and it was a beautiful, clear day. We were lulled into complacency. We 
      would take only an occasional look at the sky for enemy planes as we sat 
      around the gun pit discussing the excitement of the night before. At about 
      noon, Spearing was on the phone when, suddenly, he jumped into the pit and 
      onto the horizontal tracking seat (his regular assignment) as he yelled, 
      "Kaiser's (yes, his name was Kaiser!) been hit by strafing 
      ME-109's!"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      looked down toward the Lorelei bend in the river, and, sure enough, coming 
      along at a very low altitude on our side of the river were two planes and 
      they were strafing our gun positions. The red flashes were blazing from 
      their machine guns. The only problem was they were not German ME-109 
      Messerschmitt's but American P-51 Mustang's (See Figs.101 and 102 for 
      comparison).</font></p>

        >Even though the engineers and infantry were making 
        good progress in clearing the Germans out of St. Goarshausen, they 
        continued to be harassed by fire coming from the high ground of the 
        famous Lorelei Rock, which was just upstream of the town. Six P-51 
        fighter planes were called in to blast these gun positions.<sup

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      could see the skin of the planes was metallic (the Germans used camouflage 
      colors), and the big white stars on their wings were clearly visible as 
      they made the turn in the river. They completed the turn and were headed 
      directly at us. We were busy getting into position to fire with Spearing 
      and Bapst, the two trackers, cranking like mad to turn the gun in the 
      planes' direction.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      question was, did we shoot at our own planes? Without any discussion, the 
      answer evidently was "yes" because everyone continued to ready the gun for 
      firing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
      realized the planes would be directly overhead before we could get off our 
      first shot. I grabbed the clutch at the back of the gun mount and pulled 
      it up, disengaging the gears the trackers used with their hand cranks. 
      Spearing, Bapst, and Wellington, the loader who was standing up on the 
      platform, all yelled at me, "What are you doing?" I spun the gun around 
      180 degrees, so we could shoot on the downward leg. The three men were 
      holding onto the gun to keep from being spun off during the rotation. At 
      about the time when the planes went screaming by overhead, I reengaged the 
      clutch, and the tracker searched out a target. The planes were so low when 
      they went over our pit we could have hit them by throwing rocks. They were 
      probably out of ammunition by the time they got to us because they had 
      stopped strafing. Ack-ack tracers were coming from all directions. Our 
      trackers picked up the second plane, which was a lucky move. The other 
      plane stayed low, and was soon out of sight.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      second plane nosed up into a 45-degree climb and made a perfect target for 
      us. We were firing at it along with the other guns in the area when it 
      took a hit. The left wing blew off, the cockpit canopy came off, the pilot 
      bailed out, and the plane headed down into the river valley, seemingly all 
      at the same time. The pilot pulled his parachute's ripcord and the last 
      time we saw him, the chute was strung out behind him, but it was not 
      billowing. He was headed down into the valley, and it looked like he was 
      going to land somewhere on the outskirts of the town of St. Goarshausen. 
      Some of the members of the other gun crews were on the phone "taking 
      credit for downing the German Messerschmitt ME-109."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      canopy got caught up in the wind and sailed over near our pit where 
      several of us went and picked it up. We brought it back to our gun 
      position, where I grabbed the field telephone. As I put the receiver end 
      to my ear, I heard the debate about the type of plane that had been downed 
      was still going on.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >"Scratch one Messerschmitt!" cried a voice coming in 
      from one of our gun sections. The pride in his voice was obvious. I pushed 
      the butterfly switch on the phone and said, "This is Gallagher, gun 
      section number one, and we just picked up the canopy from that downed 
      plane. For all of you idiots out there who identified it as a 
      Messerschmitt, how do you figure that stenciled on the inside of the 
      canopy are a lot of serial numbers and the words 'Made by the North 
      American Aviation Company.' The last I heard, that is not a German 
      Company." I released the butterfly switch so I could listen but there was 
      a long pause as nobody spoke.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Finally, Bill Sorenson in gun section number four got 
      on the line and said, "How in the hell could they miss it? It was all 
      silver with that big white star all over it. " (Bill and I had been the 
      two best at identifying planes when we did so by flash-cards back in the 
      States, and nobody would have challenged us even if we had less imposing 
      evidence.) Bill then asked, "What else is written on the canopy, 
      Bob?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
      said, "The pilot's name, Lieutenant A. L. Vic, is written on the 
      outside."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Someone else, whose voice I didn't recognize got on 
      the phone and told me, "Hang on to it, Gallagher, we'll be right out to 
      pick it up."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      I hung up, I turned to Dillon and said, "He said to hang on to it. What 
      does he think we're going to do with it, eat it?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      canopy was shattered, so several of us in our gun section broke off pieces 
      of the plexi-glass for souvenirs. In about 15 minutes, two Jeeps from 
      Headquarters showed up and took the canopy away. Some time later, we were 
      told the pilot had broken both of his legs from the fall, but he was 
      recovering in a hospital.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      amazed me some of the men in our battalion still could not distinguish 
      between enemy planes and our own. Despite the fact we had all sat through 
      hundreds of hours of training in aircraft identification, despite the fact 
      we had previously been attacked by real Messerschmitts, and despite the 
      fact the American planes we had just fired on were right on top of us, 
      they still made the wrong identification. I suppose, to give them the 
      benefit of the doubt, some gun crews were not as close to the planes as we 
      were. We learned later several of our crews took cover in their pits after 
      identifying the plane as American. That had been my first reaction but I 
      got caught up in all of the excitement along with the others who were 
      firing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      turned out that Kaiser had been hit only with flying dirt and was not 
      seriously hurt. Several of his buddies wanted him to cut himself with a 
      knife because, if he bled, he would get a Purple Heart medal. He didn't. 
      There was also some discussion about whether you were eligible for a 
      Purple Heart medal if the wound was inflicted by friendly fire.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      strafing planes made some hits on equipment, but no one else was hurt. 
      Much later, we learned that the American Ninth Air Force, of which these 
      planes were part, had been labeled as "the American Luftwaffe" because of 
      their prior attacks on American ground forces in Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      the war was over and letters were no longer censored, I wrote to a friend 
      of mine named Frank Papie who was stationed in England with the Eighth Air 
      Force. I told him about shooting down an American plane. He wrote back and 
      said sarcastically, "Keep up the good work, Gallagher - (if you shoot 
      down) four more American planes and you'll be a German Ace."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Many 
      years after the war (fifty-three to be exact - it was 1998), I learned 
      more about the shooting-down of the P-51 Mustang. The incident happened on 
      March 26, 1945. The planes that strafed us were from the 354th Fighter 
      Group, which was part of the Ninth Air Force. They were flying out of an 
      airfield in Plateau Lorraine near Metz, France, and the following 
      information is taken from Microfilm roll BO-0312, frame 1760, of the Group 
      records.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">17 
        missions were flown this day by the 354 FG (Fighter Group) with the use 
        of 134 P-51 sorties. 1 aircraft was lost out of the 17 missions, that 
        being Mark (NMI) Baldwin who was slightly wounded due to bailing 
        out.</font></p></blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      turned out that the plane we shot down belonged to Lt. A.L. Vic but it was 
      being flown on that day by Lt. Mark Baldwin, so, for over 50 years, I had 
      the wrong name for the pilot.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It is 
      interesting to observe the many contradictions between what I observed to 
      be happening and what was reported in the Oprep. Of most significance was 
      the fact the pilot of the plane was not Lt. A. L. Vic. Also of interest 
      was the fact the pilots in the mission did not mention they had strafed 
      our gun positions. Another contradiction was they were to make a pass from 
      West to East. Actually they approached from the southeast.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 
      1998, after I learned from the Oprep report the pilot was Lt. Mark 
      Baldwin, I found he lived before and after the war in a small town called 
      Gillett, near Green Bay, Wisconsin. I called his home and found out, by 
      talking to his son, that he had been killed in an airplane accident 
      four<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Lt. Mark Baldwin" vspace="8" src="images/Lt_Mark_Baldwin_18_103.jpg" width="215" align="right" height="336" > 
      years prior to my call. His son sent me a picture of Lt. Baldwin (See Fig. 
      103). The son told me in the incident during the war, his father had 
      bailed out when his plane caught fire and his legs were quite badly 
      burned. However, after a series of operations he was able to lead a normal 
      life. He was a member of the Wisconsin Air National Guard for many years 
      after the war and flew his own small civilian airplane. He eventually 
      crashed into a forest, which resulted in his death.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      the war, Lt. Baldwin had written a summary of what had happened on the 
      date he was shot down near the town of St. Goar:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
        morning mission over western Germany was canceled because the weather 
        was overcast with the ceilings about 800 feet. There were breaks in the 
        overcast and the visibility was seven miles. As there were breaks in the 
        overcast, operations decided to send a weather reconnaissance over enemy 
        lines to evaluate the possibility of bombing through the breaks or under 
        the clouds. "A" flight left late in the morning with no external 
        armament.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
        >After searching the target area for an hour, and 
        finding no areas suitable for operations, flight leader headed west to 
        return to A-98. As we went West the breaks in the cloud cover reappeared 
        about the time we were about to cross the bomb line. At this time a 
        Forward Air Controller called us saying he had heard us calling back to 
        our base and he asked for help with a ground action.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
        ground forces were trying to cross the Rhine River, but were held up by 
        88 mm artillery on the Eastern bluff of the river. Flight lead agreed to 
        try strafing the gun positions from the west, breaking to the North. As 
        the river bulged into our lines at this point we would be over enemy 
        territory only a very short time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
        made the strafing run in two ship elements wide abreast so the wingman 
        could select his target. I had just armed my guns and was trying to 
        pinpoint my target before getting in range when there was an impact as 
        the airplane bucked slightly and the engine quit cold. I broke left away 
        from my wingman and to the north to stay over friendly troops. Pulling 
        up to gain altitude, trying to restart the engine, and at the same time 
        looking for a place to land.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">By 
        this time I knew I was going down, so I blew the canopy with the 
        emergency release handle and was about to call for help when everything 
        turned to fire. Someone said, "Baldwin, get out of there," but I was too 
        occupied to answer. The fire made it impossible to see anything so I 
        released the safety belt and stood up and was frozen against the 
        headrest by the two hundred mph wind blast. The only thing I could do 
        was get my right leg up on the edge of the cockpit and heave myself out. 
        Somehow I missed the tail and fell free with the horizon rotating in 
        front of me. I reached for the rip cord, missing it because I could not 
        bend my fingers, but getting it with my thumb, the chute opened 
        immediately. My finger movement was restricted because the fire had 
        shrunk the leather of my gloves until they were so small I could not 
        bend my fingers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
        looked down at my bare legs because my pants were burned off by the fire 
        and one boot had fallen off as the laces were burned. My helmet, goggles 
        and oxygen mask were torn off by the wind blast and the outer cotton of 
        my flight jacket was burned off. It was very quiet after all the wind 
        noise, but I was close to the ground with nothing but trees divided by a 
        narrow dirt road below. On the road a jeep was moving with three 
        American soldiers in it and, as I crossed overhead, I hollered at them. 
        Right after this I fell through the tops of the pine trees and stopped, 
        hanging in the harness fifteen feet from the ground.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
        >Almost immediately I heard the soldiers from the 
        Jeep coming through the woods looking for me, and I could tell from the 
        conversation they thought I was the enemy. I did not see him but one GI 
        called to the other "Here he is," and the reply was, "You going to shoot 
        the Son of a Bitch." Realizing this was a serious situation I said a few 
        typically American cuss words, which seemed to convince them I should 
        not be shot, but they still pointed the carbine at me until I threw down 
        my side arm.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
        was going into shock, and I remembered the morphine syrette in the first 
        aid kit attached to the parachute harness. When I reached for it, it was 
        nothing but ashes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 
        order to get down from the tree, I used my teeth to tear my gloves off 
        so that I could use my hands. Then I managed to grab a branch to get to 
        a trunk of a tree to get to the ground. Medics came and took me to a 
        field hospital and ten months for convalescence from burns and shrapnel 
        wound.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It 
      was quite a coincidence that despite all the many GIs who were now in St. 
      Goarshausen, the three that Lt. Baldwin mentions above were from our 
      antiaircraft unit, the same unit that shot him down. These men were part 
      of our communications detail.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      information from the Oprep Report and Lt. Baldwin's personal account not 
      only corrected the fact that Lt. Vic was not the pilot who was shot down 
      but also cleared up some questions I had about the event. I always 
      wondered why the plane went into a climb instead of staying low with the 
      other one. Also, how did the pilot eject from the plane so fast when one 
      of his wings was shot off? Lt. Baldwin's notes made it clear the plane had 
      been hit earlier (before his plane went into a climb) and he was gaining 
      altitude so he could bail out at a higher elevation. He was already on his 
      way out of the plane when the wing was shot off.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After 
      the P-51 shoot-down incident, most of the rest of the day was spent 
      discussing what had happened down in the valley since midnight. It 
      undoubtedly had been the most exciting time any of us had experienced. We 
      tried to put the different incidents that had happened in order and, even 
      though it was just a matter of a few hours, there was much disagreement 
      about exactly and in what sequence things had happened. The one thing we 
      all agreed on was how terrible the loss of American lives had been. This 
      was only one small battle that was being repeated around the world. We all 
      agreed we were an extremely lucky bunch of soldiers who did not have to 
      fight like those we had just observed first hand.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      this discussion was going on, I looked over at Bob Armbruster, with his 
      lanky frame sitting</font><font size="3" face="Arial"> on 
      top of the sandbags with his feet dangling in the pit and the long trunk 
      of his body arched</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="GIs raise flag at Lorelei" vspace="8" src="images/Raising_Flag_Lorelei_18_104.jpg" width="280" align="right" height="504" ><font size="3" 
      face=Arial> forward with his head bowed. He was a 
      very religious person, and I knew he was silently saying prayers for those 
      who were wounded or had died. Others noticed it too, and there was a long 
      silence with each man left to his own thoughts.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">By 
      late afternoon, the 89th division was able to raise the American flag and 
      the Division colors on the summit of the Lorelei - a symbol of the 
      teamwork and individual courage which had carried the Rolling W (89th) to 
      victory across Germany's mightiest barrier (See Fig. 104).<sup 
      >15</sup></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Several factors, in addition to the terrain, had made 
      the actual crossing difficult. We learned later the Germans had 
      anticipated and prepared for an assault at St. Goarshausen. They were well 
      dug in and had the advantage of firing down from higher positions. Also, 
      the logistics of not having enough assault boats and the length of time 
      required to make a round trip were great handicaps for the GIs.<sup 
      >16</sup></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      heard our Headquarters Battery had moved down into St. Goar to set up 
      their command post.<br>The next day, March 27th, the 
      engineers started to construct the bridge across the Rhine River (See 
      Figs. 105, 106 and 107). It had been started several times the day before 
      only to be stopped by enemy fire, resulting in casualties. We made several 
      trips up to the rim to observe their progress.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      bridge was called either a pontoon bridge or a treadway bridge. It was 
      capable of supporting heavy equipment like trucks, artillery pieces, and 
      even tanks. One of its great advantages, in addition to the fact that 
      trucks could carry its parts, was the speed with which they could be 
      assembled.</font></p>

      >Erection of the treadway bridge by the 243rd 
      Engineering Combat Battalion was scheduled to start at 0800 hours on the 
      26th but the enemy had not yet been cleared from the opposite bank by that 
      time. When completed, the bridge across the Rhine River was 828 feet long 
      and took twenty-five hours and fifty minutes to complete.<sup

      >Immediately upon the bridge's completion, trucks with 
      men aboard, artillery pieces, armored vehicles and supply trucks would 
      begin pouring across. Another door into the heartland of Germany was 
      opened, and the Third Army was taking full advantage of its 
      convenience.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      next morning we were going about our normal duties when we noticed an odor 
      permeating the pit area. Looking around, we found a trench nearby we had 
      not noticed before with the bodies of two German soldiers in it who had 
      been dead for some time. We assumed they had been holed up there as a 
      rear-guard to slow the American troops down when the German army was 
      retreating across the river some days before. Le Claire reached in to get 
      their identification tags. We were going to cover them with dirt, stick 
      their rifles out of the ground, and hang the tags from the guns. Le Claire 
      saw a photo one of the dead men was still holding so he pulled it out and 
      showed it to us. It was a picture of a young woman holding the hand of a 
      child about three years old, and we concluded they were the soldier's wife 
      and child. None of us said anything to each other, but things were somber. 
      The picture registered a whole new perspective to the war and the killing 
      that went with it. Even though we had seen many dead soldiers in Europe 
      before that time, both American and Germans, we had thought of them only 
      in the context of casualties of the war. They had not been identified with 
      wives and children or anyone else for that matter. This incident made us 
      think about the fact that for every casualty we saw, there was a whole 
      string of people someplace who indirectly would also be victims of the 
      war.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In my 
      own thoughts, I felt it was more than a little ironic we should be feeling 
      sorry for these dead German soldiers when many of our fellow GIs had been 
      annihilated the night before down in the valley. Whatever the strange 
      anomaly of feelings, the tiny picture of a mother and child somehow 
      distracted from the great achievement we had witnessed: the crossing of 
      the Rhine River by the Allied troops.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      decided not to bury the two soldiers, but I don't remember why. We just 
      put a piece of tarpaulin over the trench to mask the smell and left it 
      there until we were ready to move.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Back 
      at the gun pit, we discussed the two dead Germans. Were they loyal Nazis 
      who goose-stepped past Hitler with great pride in all the regime 
      represented? Or were they good family men who were drafted into the war to 
      do a dirty job just like a lot of American GIs, and found themselves in a 
      predicament of kill or be killed? Did they kill any GIs? The photo told us 
      one of them had a family, but not much more. What else was there about 
      them we did not know? The subject made interesting conversation, but the 
      incident did not make a lasting impression on us. Because we had no true 
      remorse, it was easy to avoid deep feelings about the two dead soldiers 
      and to slip back into thoughts about the work at hand. We soon forgot 
      about the two dead Germans.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      next day, two men from our machine gun crew who were not on duty, Crow and 
      Hughes, walked back into the forest about a block away to go deer hunting. 
      We had seen deer on our two previous trips through it. The two hunters 
      were both from the south and were always looking for some bird or animal 
      to shoot at. Most of the rest of us had not been exposed to hunting in 
      civilian life, and we looked on them with a certain feeling of 
      disapproval. Why would you want to shoot a living thing just for the fun 
      of it? It all went back to how we were raised and to what had been passed 
      down to us by our fathers.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      two of them came back with a dead fawn draped over Hughes's shoulders and 
      there was blood all over his uniform. They appeared to be very proud of 
      themselves. Most of us thought it was a pretty disgusting sight but we 
      said nothing. They were going to prepare the deer and then roast it over 
      an open fire. They invited us to the feast. We said, "No, thanks," and 
      told them to build the fire far back from the rim and down near the road. 
      As they walked away, Dillon had second thoughts and yelled to them, 
      "Forget about the deer. Spend your spare time hanging around the M-51 
      mount in case you're needed." We had never been so close to enemy 
      positions even though they had just been pushed back a bit, and he decided 
      this was no time for a picnic.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When 
      I was off duty later that day, Joe Bernal and I decided to go back into 
      the same woods and look around. We had no special objective in mind except 
      it would be something different to do. Just hanging around a gun pit was 
      getting very boring, and with no populated area nearby, there weren't many 
      alternatives for exploration. On the way there, Joe said he wasn't feeling 
      good and decided to go back to the tent area and lie down. I went on 
      alone. After walking in the woods for a short period of time, I spotted a 
      large buck grazing in a clearing. Instinctively, I raised my rifle to 
      shoot and then realized that I really didn't want to shoot him. I decided 
      to see how close I could get to him instead. I was surprised how near I 
      got before he bolted into the trees.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As I 
      was standing there on the edge of the clearing, I saw something move out 
      of the corner of my eye. It was two civilian men who were no more than 
      thirty feet away before they spotted me. They were carrying two suitcases 
      each and could not have been more surprised. The men were about thirty or 
      thirty-five years old, the age for military service, I thought 
      immediately. I pulled my rifle down off my shoulder and challenged them 
      with a "Halt!" They dropped their suitcases but did not put their hands 
      up. Now what! What do I do with them? They did not speak English, or, at 
      least, they pretended not to because they looked blank as I fired 
      questions at them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      questioning them, I kept running other questions through my mind. Do I 
      search them? This would be hard to do and possibly dangerous working with 
      an awkward rifle instead of a pistol. What did I expect to find? What was 
      in those suitcases? Was it some of that loot we heard the Germans had 
      taken from their victims, or was it just their clothing and personal 
      effects? Why were they walking in the woods instead of out in the open 
      areas adjoining it? Did I bring them back to the gun pit and call 
      headquarters to come and pick them up? The problem was, I was more worried 
      about the questions I would have to answer than the ones they would. How 
      would I explain what I was doing in the woods in the first place, and what 
      was my answer to such questions as "What did they do?" and "They were just 
      passing by?" That didn't sound illegal. It would all depend on what was in 
      those suitcases. Getting involved with one of our officers who would not 
      know how to handle the matter in the first place immediately ruled out 
      that decision.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
      debated checking the suitcases after moving the men back away from them 
      but decided the easiest thing to do would be to end the matter. I told 
      them to proceed on. For years, I wondered who these men were and what were 
      they up to. Did I do the right thing in releasing them, and what really 
      was in those suitcases? When I told the crew about the incident and the 
      suitcases there was wide speculation about what they contained. It went 
      all the way from Hitler's personal papers to a fortune in diamonds. I felt 
      Bapst was closer to the truth when he said, "They probably live in the 
      next town and were bringing their dirty laundry home to their mothers for 
      washing."</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b 
      >A Move Down To The River's Bank</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      stayed two more days up on the rim, and then we got March Order. We packed 
      up and moved down into the town of St. Goar to set up positions next to 
      the river with all of its natural beauty.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      engineers had completed the pontoon bridge, and we were to guard it 
      against attack. Gun crews were scattered along the bank of the river for 
      about half a mile in each direction from the bridge. Some of the gun 
      sections from other batteries in our Battalion went across and set up 
      positions on the opposite bank. Some of them were located upstream as far 
      as the Lorelei bend.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There 
      was a steady stream of trucks, armored vehicles, and equipment moving down 
      from the rim and across the Rhine River. We watched the 155mm howitzers 
      that had been throwing shells over our heads a few nights earlier navigate 
      down the steep road into St. Goar. The huge guns being pulled by 
      full-tracked prime movers made a spectacular sight as they slowly inched 
      downward</font><img border="0" hspace="8" alt="155mm Howitzer" vspace="8" src="images/155_Howitzer_18_108.jpg" width="350" align="right" height="385" ><font 
      size=3 face=Arial> (See Fig. 108). Their brakes let 
      out loud screeching noises as they labored to stem the forces trying to 
      propel the rig downhill faster than was safe. They looked like some 
      gigantic monster cannons that were never supposed to be mobile artillery 
      pieces. They assembled in town and then moved across the pontoon bridge 
      one at a time. Their enormous weight was a real test of the bridge's 
      stability, and the engineers carefully observed each gun's progress all 
      the way across.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      engineers had about ten sharpshooters stationed along the length of the 
      pontoon bridge facing upstream where they would shoot at anything floating 
      down the river in case the Germans sent down explosives to the bridge. 
      Intelligence sources had also reported the possibility of Gamma swimmers 
      attacking the bridge. The noise from these sharpshooters occasionally 
      firing always got our attention and often startled us. Although they were 
      only using M-1 rifles and a few BARs, the shots were magnified many times 
      as the noise ricocheted off of the canyon walls.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      dug our gun in right next to the river on a little bluff that sat about 
      ten feet above the water level. The pontoon bridge was about two hundred 
      feet upstream of this position. The machine gun crew was about a hundred 
      feet downstream. After completing the pit, we started to look around for 
      some place to bed down. One of the crew stumbled on a real jewel. It was 
      an impressive looking three-story home (one of the few in the town) with a 
      white stucco exterior ideally located for our use. It was about two 
      hundred feet directly inland from our gun, on a slope, so from the house 
      we could look right down on the 40mm gun and machine gun pits. Located 
      about three hundred feet directly downstream from the house was another 
      castle. (See Fig.109). We found out it was built in the year 1245 and was 
      called Burg Rheinfels. Dillon, Grimes and I could not figure out why we 
      had not seen it the night we went down into the town with Lieutenant 
      Kraft. It dominated the local landscape.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="Burg Rheinfels Castle" src="images/Burg_Rheinfels_Castle_18_109.jpg" width="500" height="368" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">From 
      rummaging through the house, we concluded a very high ranking German Naval 
      Officer and his family had recently occupied it. They must have retreated 
      with the German army when the American Army advanced on the town. 
      Evidently, the family had left in a hurry. All the furniture, and 
      everything that went with it, was still in place. Deep plush leather 
      furniture, expensive-looking oil paintings adorning the walls, elaborately 
      carved tables, oriental rugs on the floors, heavily draped windows and 
      objects d'art. The dining room was beautifully decorated with ornate, 
      almost regal looking furniture. The table with its rich wood was big 
      enough to seat about twenty people. The high-backed chairs were 
      upholstered in tapestry. The doors were all large and ornate and windows 
      throughout the house were trimmed with heavy, rich-looking wood. The house 
      in general was done up in a style we crew members had seen only in some 
      elaborate movie set. The kitchen had rotting food left on the table and 
      counters. While searching thorough the house, we found the naval officer's 
      picture albums, and many of the pictures were of high-ranking Nazi 
      officers and officials, including Admiral Doernitz (he would later sign 
      the surrender treaty for the German people after Adolf Hitler committed 
      suicide). There were pictures of the family and their friends at costume 
      parties that rivaled any of the elaborate Hollywood movie scenes of that 
      era. The sophisticated furniture and the photographs of luxury living were 
      a conspicuous statement of the owner's wealthy and social 
      prominence.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On 
      the upper floor of the house were bedrooms with fine linen and bedclothes. 
      The baths were elaborate with much marble but the plumbing was not 
      working. The second floor had a living room, dining room, kitchen, and a 
      library where we spent most of our time. The first floor was for servants, 
      and it had a large storage area. In this area, there were hundreds of jars 
      of canned fruit and vegetables and many bags of potatoes and onions. There 
      did not seem to be any shortage of food in this home, unlike other parts 
      of Europe, especially in Germany.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      settled in for an extended stay.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      we were at this location, we slept in the beds and ate at the dining room 
      table even though it was often just eating out of cans from our rations. 
      There was a large verandah off the second floor,<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="LeClaire gets haircut - St. Goar" vspace="8" src="images/St_Goar_LeClaire_Haircut_18_110.jpg" width="300" align="left" height="492" > and we sat out 
      on it when we were not on duty, enjoying the panoramic and breathtaking 
      view. It was early spring and most of the flowering bushes and trees were 
      in bloom. There was the strong smell of lilac bushes in the air. The 
      weather was mild, and the sun shone every day. The banks of the gorge were 
      lush green and ablaze with color from the spring blossoms. There were 
      large plots of terraced land used for vineyards in better times that 
      flowed down the hillsides. The river glistened from rays of the sun. The 
      view was primarily upstream which meant that, in addition to the river, we 
      were looking at the main part of the town of St. Goar. Off in the distance 
      where the river made a bend was the Lorelei cliff, where a large 
      outcropping of rock rises straight up for three hundred fifty feet. The 
      scene would have made a good cover for a travel brochure. Despite the fact 
      heavy fighting had gone on there a few days ago, the town still looked 
      picturesque. It all looked so peaceful and normal. Even the engineer's 
      treadway bridge with the steady stream of military vehicles passing over 
      it added something positive to the view. It furnished us with a feeling 
      the Third Army was moving deeper into the heart of Germany and we were 
      winning the war.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were all starting to look quite shaggy from not having haircuts so we made 
      Le Claire the resident barber. He set up shop out on the veranda. It was 
      his first experience at this trade and the results showed it. After the 
      haircuts, Crow took over the barber job and gave Le Claire a shave with a 
      straight razor (See Fig. 110).</font></p>

      and moved a desk out there for writing letters home. (See Fig.

      <p><img border="0" alt="On the veranda overlooking the Rhine River" src="images/Rhine_River_18_110a.jpg" width="700" height="492" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While 
      we were at this location, it was difficult to concentrate on the fact 
      there was a war going on.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >We took turns on gun duty, so there was a lot of 
      leisure time. Ordinarily, we would use this time to roam around the area 
      and see what was going on, but here the officers were watching us too 
      closely. It was the only drawback to that location because a safe 
      environment had brought out the brass. Also, St. Goar was such a small 
      town we knew we would be observed no matter where we went. So we just 
      lounged around the house on the plush leather furniture, talking, reading, 
      and writing letters home.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">All 
      our letters had to be turned into headquarters, where they were censored, 
      polygraphed (copied), miniaturized on 16 mm microfilmed (making it easier 
      to transport) and then sent to the States where they were developed and 
      sent to their destinations. The end product was a sheet of paper about 
      4-inches by 5-inches that was called V-mail (See Fig. 111}.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Tom 
      Broderick, a close friend of the author in civilian life wrote this letter 
      to his family on August 15, 1944 while he was stationed in England. He was 
      a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. In the month following this 
      writing, he would make a jump into enemy territory near the town of Arnem, 
      Holland as part of a major military operation called Market Garden. The 
      plan was to drive the Allied forces deep into Germany. Somewhere between 
      the town of Arnem and the Nijmegen Bridge spanning the Rhine River, the 
      final objective of the operation, he would receive a devastating wound 
      that would affect his life ever after.</font></p>
      <p><img border="0" alt="V-Mail Letter" src="images/V-Mail_Letter_18_111.jpg" width="482" height="640" ></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Most 
      of us sent a minimum number of letters for three reasons. One, usually it 
      was not convenient to do so. Two, there wasn't much to tell considering we 
      could not explain where we were, what was going on, or even what the 
      weather was like. Also, we did not want to worry our parents or loved ones 
      so we did not mention unpleasant things. They were getting a very 
      distorted picture of what was going on. Third, the officers in our battery 
      were censoring our outgoing mail, and we did not want them to know our 
      personal business. Despite their assurance that they did not repeat 
      anything they read, we heard rumors they did. The censorship also kept us 
      from griping about conditions, our number one topic of discussion. 
      Censoring was done on a random basis so occasionally we would try to slip 
      some information through. Usually, in the return mail, we would be told 
      the letter we had written was unreadable.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      large library in the house was located off the living room and from 
      ceiling to floor it was rich-looking, highly polished wood. It had an 
      extensive number of books. We could not read any of them because they were 
      all written in German, but we could look at the pictures. A good number of 
      them were pornographic. These were not the usual cheap publications that 
      this kind of literature was known for at this period in history. The pages 
      were all high-gloss paper, and most of the covers were ornate leather. 
      Some of them had locks on them so we finally found a use for the bayonets 
      we had been carrying around since the early days of our training. They 
      made good lock openers. One of our crew mentioned on the phone, down at 
      the gun pit, that we had found these kinds of publication. That same day, 
      First Sergeant Ambrose showed up and hauled them all away. "To keep our 
      minds pure," someone commented sarcastically. We had not yet learned to 
      keep information from him. He was a lot better guy than Monteleone, but he 
      had his moments.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Sleeping in the beds was the most fun. With some men 
      manning the 40mm gun and the M-51 mount at all times, there were enough 
      beds for all those who were off duty. From force of habit, we did not take 
      our clothing off before going to bed. There were a lot of comments about 
      sleeping with white sheets, something that was entirely missing in Army 
      life. Bapst found some washcloths in a linen room and he passed them out 
      to the others with the comment, "Don't let Captain Mc Kee see you with 
      that or he might get you transferred out of this outfit." It was a 
      reference to one of Mc Kee's off-the-wall comments, "Real men don't use 
      washcloths or umbrellas." Despite all the amenities of the house, we were 
      still bathing out of our helmets because there was no running water. The 
      latrine was a small trench located behind the house in some 
      bushes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were getting some fresh food about three times a week, and we ate 
      C-rations on the other days. We opened some of the jars of fruit from the 
      cellar to supplement the Army chow. We had been warned not to eat any 
      civilian food because it might be poisoned. The first jar we opened was 
      cherries, and we had planned to eat just one of them. If the fruit was 
      poisoned, we would not get too sick from just one, or at least that's how 
      the reasoning went. About thirty seconds after downing the first one, we 
      continued to eat them, consuming the rest of the jar. Because they were so 
      delicious, we could not wait. Fortunately, they were not poisoned. We 
      moved a lot of our favorites (cherries, pears, peaches, and apricots) up 
      into the kitchen, and we ate some every day we were at the 
      location.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">One 
      evening when I had just come in from gun duty, I saw the dining room table 
      had been set. There was a linen tablecloth, fine china, silverware, 
      crystal glassware, and lit candelabra on the table. One of our 
      crewmembers, Bob Armbruster (See Fig. 112a), had set it up. Bob was one 
      of<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="Bob Armbruster" vspace="8" src="images/Ambruster_18_112.jpg" width="244" align="right" height="319" > the few 
      older men in our crew: about thirty-five years old at the time. Most of us 
      were in our late teens or early twenties, so we looked on him as a father 
      figure. He was tall and thin with a dynamic personality that kept him busy 
      at all times. Bob had a sophisticated manner about him that shone through 
      even when he was doing the most ordinary things of Army life. The rest of 
      us were always horsing around with each other, and while he was very 
      serious, he made no attempt to lecture us. He had strong religious beliefs 
      and accepted the hardships of army life without complaining. While he was 
      a good example for the rest of us, he did not have the effect of tempering 
      the expressions of dissatisfaction of our military experiences we voiced 
      frequently.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">That 
      evening the men who were off duty sat down at this magnificent table to 
      eat our meal. It was one of the times when we got fresh food from the 
      battery kitchen set up somewhere in town. Bob, who was not known for his 
      humor, played the part of a waiter served the meal. He draped a large 
      white linen napkin over his left arm and referred to each of us as "sir" 
      as he served the meal. Because he was out of character, his antics 
      produced a lot of laughs. We all complimented him on doing such a great 
      job setting the table, preparing the meal, and serving it in such a grand 
      manner. After he had served all the men in the house, Bob sat down to eat 
      his meal, and he asked if we wanted to continue with this way of eating 
      while we were at this location. We all gave a rousing and enthusiastic, 
      "Yes!" Bob then informed us that in order to spread the workload out, he 
      would need two men for KP duty, one in the morning and another in the 
      evening.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">"What 
      did he say? KP duty!"</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">That 
      was a different story. It was the last formal dinner we had and we went 
      back to eating out of mess kits and tin cans. We all liked the good life 
      but not at the expense of being on KP duty again. Bob was very 
      disappointed in us, but it wasn't the first time nor would it be the 
      last.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Stevens, who was still doing KP duty as part of his 
      daily assignments, had helped Bob prepare the meal, which we began 
      referring to as "the last supper." Stevens' contribution was primarily in 
      building a fire in one of the house's several fireplaces to heat the food. 
      He shook Bob up when he brought an ax into the house and announced he was 
      going to chop up the dining room table for kindling wood. The table was 
      made of inlaid wood and its beauty was striking even to a bunch of men who 
      had all but forgotten what beauty looked like. Fortunately, Bob stopped 
      him before he started to dismantle it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">One 
      afternoon, when I was off duty, we heard the sound of people speaking 
      German down by the cellar door at ground level. Bapst and I grabbed our 
      guns, threw them over our shoulders, put on our helmets, and headed down 
      the stairs. We never went outside without our helmets. I don't know if we 
      were expecting General Patton to pop up around the corner with his 
      pearl-handled pistols and those yellow leather gloves, ready to slap us 
      across the face for being out of uniform, or if we had just gotten into a 
      habit. Down at the side of the house on a walkway, there were about twenty 
      civilians, mostly women and children going in and out of the basement 
      carrying armloads of food. The two men with this crowd were well over 
      seventy years old. Just like we had observed in other parts of Germany, it 
      was rare to see a civilian man between the ages of seventeen and seventy. 
      By this time in the war, the great majority of them were either in 
      uniform, dead, or prisoners of war.<br>The civilians 
      were filling up small wagons they had brought with them to carry their 
      loot. Bapst and I started to yell, "Raus mit dir! (Get out.) Raus! Raus!" 
      They all left in a hurry except for one young boy, who was about nine 
      years old. He stood by his wagon and kept looking at the door to the 
      cellar; that told us there was someone still in there. The boy kept 
      staring at our rifles, and he was very scared. I was about to go into the 
      cellar when a frail looking woman came out carrying a bag of potatoes. She 
      was struggling with it because of its size and weight. It seemed way too 
      heavy for her. I figured she was the boy's mother or possibly a 
      grandmother. She was about five-foot two-inches tall and probably weighed 
      no more than a hundred pounds. She had a babushka on her head, and wore a 
      peasant housedress that hung down to her shoe tops. Her well-scuffed shoes 
      laced up over her ankles.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Bapst 
      and I yelled, "Raus, Raus," as we pointed our guns at her. The guns did 
      not have rounds in the chambers, but she didn't know that. I thought Bapst 
      and I looked quite menacing because we both stood over six feet tall and 
      weighed approximately two hundred pounds each. I had my gun about three 
      feet from her, while Bapst was back a little farther.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      woman walked right up to me and pushed the barrel of my gun to the side as 
      she yelled at me in German. I heard Bapst let out a snicker from behind. 
      The woman was yelling very loud, but the only word I understood was 
      "Burgermeister" (mayor). I got the impression she was threatening to 
      report me to the local mayor. I kept yelling back at her in English, and 
      tried to make her understand that if the Burgermeister showed up, I would 
      shoot him. She had dropped the bag of potatoes on the ground when she 
      headed for me and now she returned to her task of picking them up and 
      loading them into the wagon with the help of the young boy. Without even 
      looking at Bapst or me, she then headed back down into the 
      cellar.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I 
      looked at Bapst, and he hunched his shoulders as much as to say, "What do 
      we do now"? Finally he said, "Why don't you shoot her? Either that or help 
      her with the potatoes," and then he laughed. He was a big easy-going guy 
      and would not have shot her if she had been running at him with a 
      knife.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 
      woman came back out with another bag of potatoes and put it in the wagon. 
      It was now fully loaded or I am sure she would have gone back into the 
      cellar again. She and the young boy started down the walk to the street. 
      The woman turned and gave me a parting oath that I returned in kind, 
      neither one of us fully understanding what the other was saying. As she 
      rounded the corner, Bapst yelled at her, "Say hi to Hitler," and we both 
      laughed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Bapst 
      and I turned and went back into the building. At the time, we had not 
      fully made up our minds about treating the episode as a joke but later saw 
      the irony, if not the humor, in it. Several of the crew members asked us 
      what all the commotion was about, and we just told them we had scared off 
      some civilians who were looting food from the basement. We purposely 
      neglected to mention an old woman had called our bluff. It wasn't our 
      finest moment, so we left out the details. For days later, as Bapst came 
      into the building from gun duty he would yell at me, "There's an old lady 
      wearing a babushka downstairs looking for you, Gallagher, and she's got 
      the Burgermeister with her, so, you're in big trouble." Bapst would then 
      go hysterical with laughter. The rest of the crew just looked on as they 
      tried to figure out the inside joke.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
        >Many years after the war I found more information 
        about the family that owned the house we were living in. Their name was 
        Von Viebahn. Mr. Von Viebahn (the high ranking naval officer) was killed 
        in the war and his older son was wounded later in the Rhineland battles 
        and then he also died of his wounds. At the time of our occupation of 
        the house, Mrs. Von Viebahn was living next door in a smaller house with 
        a younger son named Gotz. It was she who challenged Bapst and me as her 
        nervous son, Gotz, accompanied her. They were just claiming the food 
        that was rightfully theirs. This would account for the woman's 
        perseverance.<sup>18</sup></font></p></blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">No 
      enemy planes showed up while we were in the valley. We were enjoying this 
      location, but we were also getting bored with nothing to do. When not 
      lounging about, time was spent cleaned our military equipment and our 
      personal clothing in an effort to make up for the lack of maintenance up 
      until this time. We were getting quite proficient at bathing ourselves out 
      of our helmets and, overall, we all looked much more neat and clean than 
      when we arrived.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      considered scaling the nearby castle, but its parapet walls loomed like 
      some insurmountable mountain, so we abandoned the idea. I guess that's the 
      impression castle walls are supposed to convey. The castle in St. Goar and 
      the two across the river in St. Goarshausen were reminders the recent war 
      activities were not the first of their kind in this valley. However, our 
      war would not leave such magnificent structures for tourists to admire for 
      the many following centuries.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were getting at least one visit a day down at the gun from the officers. 
      They had to find something to justify their visit, so they usually 
      complained about something trivial. Usually it was the condition of the 
      pit that was starting to resemble an advertisement for a recruitment 
      poster from all of the detailed care it was receiving. One day, Lt. Engler 
      came by and suggested we paint the 40mm gun. He seemed to be in a good 
      mood, so I jokingly told him we were supposed to be soldiers and not 
      painters. He seemed to get a kick out of this, and I later learned it was 
      because he had been a painter in civilian life. He thought I was needling 
      him, but actually I only learned after the incident about his peacetime 
      occupation. I finally convinced him the gun looked more camouflaged the 
      way it was and he dropped the subject. In an effort to keep the idea of 
      painting from coming up again, we wiped down all the metal parts with a 
      mixture of gasoline and motor oil, which gave it a shine.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial" 
      >Things were getting to be more like training in the 
      States than a field condition. Fortunately, they left us alone in our 
      house, which was starting to get very messy from lack of any cleanup. We 
      knew that it would not pass an inspection of any kind, but, as long as we 
      did not have to, we were not about to expend energy to leave a German 
      officer's house in better condition than we had found it. On April 10th, 
      we got March Order and we prepared to move out.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We 
      were leaving St. Goar with some mixed emotions. In some ways, it would 
      have been a great place to sit out the rest of the war, but the day-to-day 
      monotony had started to weigh heavily on us. We were looking forward to 
      some new adventure at a new location.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As we 
      were leaving, we found our stay in that beautiful valley was not without 
      incident. A soldier in A-Battery who was stationed on the other side of 
      the river in St. Goarshausen had several fingers blown off a few days 
      earlier. His crew had taken over a German gun position and he was handling 
      one of their shells when it went off. He was sent to an Army hospital and 
      then back home to be discharged. We all agreed he was lucky to be alive, 
      and we were reminded about the danger of handling enemy 
      equipment.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Our 
      new destination was unknown, and we wondered if it would be as exciting 
      and interesting as St. Goar.</font></p>
