    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At Camp Shanks, they were generous with
    passes, and I managed to get one every night we were there. My buddies and I
    always headed to the island of Manhattan to visit the many places of
    entertainment. On the first night, several of us went to the Stage Door
    Canteen (See Fig. 62),</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">located just off Broadway. It was a swinging spot
    that closely resembled a nightclub with a combo or a full sized orchestra
    playing great music. The place was crowded with servicemen from all
    branches, and there were lots of girls. The rumor back at camp was the
    hostesses were showgirls from Broadway plays, but that would prove to be an
    exaggeration. I asked one of the hostesses, who was pretty enough to have
    been a showgirl, to dance. After introductions, the first thing she asked
    was, "Did you see the movie Stage Door Canteen?" I told her,
    "Yes," and the next thing she said was: "Wasn't that silly
    when they said the hostesses here can't date the servicemen?" I took
    the hint immediately, and we met that evening and every night while I was in
    the New York area. I asked her if she was in show business, and she was
    somewhat vague about the answer. Later, I learned she was trying to get into
    the business but was working in a department store to earn a living until
    she got her break. She fixed up several of my friends with her friends.
    Those girls showed us a great time, and we really saw the nightlife of New
    York City. It was obvious this was not the first time they had followed this
    routine with servicemen. We knew they were just enjoying themselves at our
    expense, but, since we were doing exactly the same thing with them, it
    really didn't make any difference. We were all having a lot of fun, and the
    fact that they knew where the city's interesting places to visit were
    located made it party time every night. When our money started to run out,
    they paid some of the expenses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I was awed by the nightlife of New York City.
    The garish neon signs, jazz joints, dance halls, bars with entertainment,
    movies, noisy traffic, crowded streets, sleazy bars, dirty subways,
    outlandish people, and overall urban environment were both exciting and
    somewhat intimidating. While I was raised in another large city, I had been
    too young to participate in the nightlife there, which I am sure did not
    approach that of New York City. Even what I experienced in Hollywood, could
    not come close to matching what was going on in that dynamic city.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The girl I was dating asked if I thought I
    would ever get to be an officer. The question stopped me cold. After a year
    and a half in service, I was still only a corporal. At that rate, it would
    take me about twenty years to become a second lieutenant. That is, if
    promotions were based on seniority, which they weren't. I don't think she
    was putting me down but she, like all young ladies, would have liked to be
    seen dating an officer much more than an enlisted man. It was the uniform,
    right? I told her I expected to get a commission soon after we got overseas,
    and she looked like she believed me. If she was going to ask a dumb
    question, she would get an even dumber answer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One morning, we got back to camp so late we
    had to run down the camp street at 0530 hours and were barely in time to
    make roll call. We stayed at this camp for five days, and the nightlife of
    New York City was taking its toll. We were all staying out so late every
    night we were starting to wear out physically.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Because I had all the information about our
    outfit's equipment from packing it, every day I would give some excuse to
    the brass about why I had to go to the warehouse where it was stored to
    check it out. I would select my buddies to go with me on the pretext we
    would have to open some boxes and move the contents. During the afternoons
    at the warehouse we would lock the door from the inside, climb on the wooden
    boxes and take a badly needed two-hour siesta. Sometimes it was longer and
    it was often the only sleep we had.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, we were told that we were on alert.
    We knew we would be leaving soon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We left Camp Shanks by train at about 2030
    hours on Sunday night that took us south to the ferry terminal at Weekhawken,
    New Jersey. There we transferred to ferries for the trip to the 42nd Street
    dock in the Port of Manhattan. When we got out on the dock proper, we
    noticed there was a very large ship on the left side of the dock and one
    considerably smaller on the right side. The word was passed around that the
    big ship was the Gray Lady, better known as the Queen Mary. She had been
    camouflaged early in the war with a dull gray paint that at first glance
    made her look more like a non-descript warehouse than an ex-luxury ship. We
    did not have to be told she was one of the world's largest passenger liners.
    We found out she was the second biggest in the world at that time with only
    the Queen Elizabeth1 being larger. We were all hoping we would turn left
    when we got on the dock. No such luck. When our names were called out, we
    turned right to go up the gangplank to the smaller ship. A small Army band
    played on the dock near the place the Queen Mary was loading, but they were
    so far away we could barely hear them. Once on board, we were directed to
    our berths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was all very exciting. Being on board a
    ship was a first for most all. As we moved into our final quarters for the
    first time, the shock at seeing our new home dampened any positive feelings.
    We realized there was no way this trip could be a pleasant experience in
    such a crowded place.</font></p>
