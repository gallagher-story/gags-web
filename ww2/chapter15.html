    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our next stop was the town of Nancy where we
    parked our convoy along the rubble-strewn streets. Civilians passed nearby
    but they gave only casual glances at us. Their mood was dour, and after we
    sat there doing nothing for about three hours, ours feelings matched theirs.
    We were not allowed to dismount the trucks and, as usual, nobody told us
    what was going on. We were surprised we were not setting up our guns to
    protect some potential target. K-rations were broken out at dusk and we
    commented how meager and unfulfilling they were. We drank water from our
    canteens.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, we unloaded, set out guards, and
    carrying our bedrolls, headed toward one of the less-damaged buildings. Our
    billet that night was a partially bombed hotel previously used by the German
    army. With the sun down, we moved among the rooms by flashlight, or
    "torch light" as the Army called them, looking for a space big
    enough to spread our sleeping bag and, hopefully, big enough to accommodate
    a couple of our buddies for company. We laid out our bedrolls on the wooden
    floors and slept about twenty to a room meant for two or three people. It
    was more than a little crowded and territorial arguments broke out. We tried
    to decipher the writing on some empty Germans ration boxes found lying about
    to determine what kind of food they had been eating. With our little
    understanding of the German language, the best we could conclude was they
    were mainly biscuits. Soon after we arrived someone in authority decided we
    needed showers so we were sent down to the basement where a freezing cold
    room had nozzles sprouting out of the walls. The water was ice cold so we
    stayed there only for a minute or so and then raced for towels that were
    furnished. It was more torture than a refreshing shower, and we did a lot of
    griping. It did not make us much cleaner because we were not there long
    enough to do any good. To make matters worse, all our clothing was in our
    duffel bags back on the trucks so we put on the same dirty clothing we
    arrived in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Our First Gun Emplacement</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The next day, we loaded up on our trucks and
    traveled north. We arrived at our first location for a gun emplacement, the
    very non-French sounding town of Woippy in the northeast corner of France
    near the city of Metz. The area, known as Alsace-Lorraine, had been the site
    of territorial battles between the French and Germans for centuries. More
    recently, the German army had put up stiff resistance in the Metz area, and
    it took the Allied Third Army several weeks to capture it prior to our
    arrival. We saw many castles in the area.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our assignment was to guard a supply depot
    somewhere in the area against German aircraft. Each gun section was assigned
    to a prescribed location around the depot. We could not see the depot and
    were there for several days before we were even given information about what
    direction it was in. None of the other gun sections in our battalion were
    visible to us. Using our long-handled shovels, we dug a triangular gun pit
    twenty-five feet by twenty feet by two-and-a-half feet deep. We manually
    pushed the 40mm gun into it, extended the side beams, lowered the gun down
    on the jacks, leveled it, and then built up rows of sand bags filled with
    the dirt dug out for the pit, about two-and-a-half feet above the natural
    ground. This made the overall pit five feet deep. We then set metal
    ammunition boxes around on the bottom of the pit. While we were working on
    the 40mm pit, the M-51 crew was digging in their weapon about two-hundred
    feet away. We had arrived at dusk, and it was daybreak the next morning
    before we were completely set up. We could have fired much earlier than that
    because, while we were digging in, the gun was sitting up on the ground next
    to the pit ready to go.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At sunup we had a full crew manning the gun
    and watching for enemy aircraft. Even though nobody had slept during the
    night, we were all so excited about being at our first combat gun position
    no one even mentioned sleep. We were all hoping something would happen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We did not have to wait long. At about
    midmorning, we spotted two planes headed in our general direction from the
    north at a very low altitude. The loader, Wellington, hustled up on the
    steel platform and cocked the gun to put a round in the firing chamber (See
    Fig. 77). The trackers, Bapst and Spearing, were already in their seats
    making adjustments in aiming the barrel of the gun with their cranks as they
    picked up the lead plane in their sights. Several men were busy opening the
    ammunition boxes. It was my job as gunner to make the final decision whether
    the planes were friend or enemy. My first impression was that they were
    Germans, but I had to be sure. They made a slight turn, and I picked up a
    cross on one of their tails and immediately identified them as ME-109
    Messerschmitts (See Fig. 78). The gun was on target so I yelled,
    "Fire!" The loader stepped on a pedal that stuck up from the steel
    platform about an inch, and the gun started to pump out projectiles at two
    per second. I was standing on the bottom of the pit behind the loader
    yelling to the trackers "Ahead, ahead!" which meant they should
    try and move their sights ahead of the planes. The idea of tracking was to
    shoot out ahead of the plane and let it fly into the shells. If they aimed
    directly at a plane, the shell would go behind it. There were two men near
    me handing up clips of six shells each to the loader, who dropped them into
    a slot at the top of the gun. Even though the other gun positions in our
    battalion were not in sight, we could see the tracers from their guns going
    up. We got off about fifteen rounds, and then the planes were gone. Later,
    we heard one of them crashed several miles south of where we were, but no
    one ever knew who got it. Several of our crew thought we had a hit, but I
    never saw it. Our projectiles would explode on impact, so a hit would
    usually be quite visible.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="German Messerschmitt" src ="images/Messerschmitt_15_78.jpg" width=550 height=336 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The M-51 mount with its four .50-caliber
    machineguns never got off a shot. The men were so busy cocking their guns,
    by the time they did shoot, the planes were gone. From that day on, we kept
    a round of ammunition in the breeches of all the guns, including the 40mm,
    with just the safety latches on. We were not supposed to, but we did it
    anyway.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After the attack, we ran several drills to
    make sure everyone knew how to act in an emergency. It had been a number of
    months since we had practiced and we had been pretty sloppy on our first
    attempt at the real thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We learned one important lesson during this
    first attack. While the tactics of attacking aircraft varied considerably,
    at that period of the war, enemy planes tended to fly at hedgehopping
    elevations, hoping to defeat our radar early warning systems and to reduce
    the time they would be within firing range of light antiaircraft weapons
    like ours. We realized there would not be much time to get ready to pick up
    the target and fire our first shot. This was not going to be like target
    practice in the Mojave Desert, where the target was dragged right across the
    front of our gun pit at slow speed and a prescribed altitude. If we were
    going to do any firing we had to be ready to open up at any angle and to do
    it in a hurry. We discussed this in detail and made sure every man knew how
    to react.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After the attack, the adrenaline was flowing
    and our mood was edgy. The gunner in the M-51 mount even started tracking
    some ducks flying over. We were all scanning the horizon for planes, but
    soon settled down and boredom set in. We learned at this gun site the
    toughest problems we were going to face were trying to constantly stay
    alert, watching the sky where almost nothing was happening, and ignoring
    what was going on around us on the ground. Staying alert was not only hard
    to do, sometimes it was impossible. There was no way to train men for this
    idle time, yet it proved to be our most difficult task.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our gun position was in the yard of an
    industrial plant on the edge of Woippy. We had two six-man pyramid-shaped
    tents as part of our equipment, but we pitched them only when we had to. It
    was one of those jobs we avoided whenever we could find a permanent
    structure to occupy. At this site, we decided to bunk down in the nearby
    plant, a factory that made wooden barrels before it was shut down as the war
    swept through this area.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We started to set schedules with each crew on
    duty for six hours and off for six hours. After some experimenting, this was
    changed to four-hour shifts, which seemed to work better. On our off time we
    could eat, sleep, or do other things. We were supposed to stay near the gun
    at all times, but we did a lot of roaming while off duty. On duty, we were
    at our set positions, scanning the sky for intruders. It was a very tedious
    job we would experience over and over again as we moved around to different
    locations in Europe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While in Woippy, our daily activities became
    completely different from the orderly life we had been accustomed to. While
    in training and again in England, everything was done at prescribed times.
    From roll call to taps, we moved on a prescribed timetable set by our
    leaders. With some variations for special duties, we had known precisely
    when eating, sleeping, and work would happen. At this first gun position,
    all this changed. Days merged with nights, breakfast was eaten at noon, and
    sleeping was done at varying times and durations. As the schedule for any
    given day became muddled, so would the days of the week and then weeks of
    the month. Saturday and Sunday had no more significance than any other day
    of the week. There were no passes or furloughs to look forward to, only more
    of the same as far as we could see out into the future. Usually, we did not
    know what day of the week it was without some lengthy concentration on the
    matter. We had no reason to know, and we could care less. Watches were
    checked only to determine when gun or guard duties would start or end. Most
    other activities rotated around those assignments.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite being in a combat zone, we had to
    keep our appearance as neat as possible. Lieutenant Engler came around in a
    Jeep and gave us all a little talk on the subject. Like our lecture in Reims,
    he dropped General Patton's name a number of times to emphasize the point.
    Everyone under Patton's command, including us, was afraid of him. There was
    almost no chance we would ever see him, but we were not about to take any
    chances. Those of us who had heavy beards shaved almost every day. It was
    usually done with cold water using our steel helmet as a basin. For a
    mirror, we each had a small piece of polished stainless steel the government
    issued along with a shaving kit. Washing our faces and hands was also done
    out of the helmet, and later there were attempts to bathe our whole bodies
    that way. This bath procedure was called a whore's bath.<br>
    Keeping our clothes clean was another matter. The only laundry we did was an
    occasional washing of our underwear. Water was limited so they had to get
    pretty grimy before we did so. It was common to wear the same woolen OD
    shirt, pants and field jacket twenty-four hours a day for a month at a time.
    We tried to change our socks and underwear at least every week, but that
    schedule was extended the longer we stayed in combat positions. All of our
    clothes were OD in color, right down to our underwear, socks, and
    handkerchiefs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had to wear our M-1 helmets every day, all
    day long. It came in two parts. The inside piece<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="World War II Steel Helmet" vspace="8" src="images/Helmet_and_%20liner_15_79.jpg" width="342" align="right" height="408"> was called a liner and was
    made of a laminated impregnated fabric with a resin base. Inside the liner
    was a sweatband and cloth strips across the top. The liner was formed to fit
    tightly inside a steel helmet (See Fig. 79). The cloth straps in the liner
    rested on the top of our heads and carried the weight of the helmet. There
    was a chinstrap on the steel shell everyone kept tied across the back of the
    helmet. It was meant to be worn under the chin to keep the helmet from
    falling off but we had been warned an enemy could easily come up from
    behind, pull the helmet back, and strangle us with it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our hair got matted down from the weight of
    the helmet because we could not wash it for weeks at a time. It would hurt
    to run a comb through it so we just didn't comb our hair.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had to keep our rifle and gas mask with us
    at all times. We hated the gas mask because it was so big and bulky. It was
    always getting in the way while we moved about. When we slept, the rifles
    and gas masks were always alongside us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We realized at this first gun position we
    were not going to get many inspections from our officers or high-ranking
    noncoms. Not even Sergeant Kornich, our platoon sergeant, who had been in
    our face every minute of every day while training in the States and even in
    England, came around on any regular basis. One of the crew said, " I
    miss him," but we all knew he was kidding. We liked this independence.
    The rumor circulated in the States that officers and high-ranking noncoms
    would become more lenient and even friendlier when we got overseas. This
    turned out to be false, but their infrequent visits to our gun sections was
    the next best thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our gun-section leader, Bud Dillon, was well
    liked by the all crewmembers. He knew how to use his authority when he had
    to, but he also gave us a lot of leeway when we were not on gun duty. His
    unique talent was his ability to balance being stern when he had to and
    wanting to be liked at other times. It was not typical behavior of most
    sergeants. He was tall, very thin, and wore his jet black hair combed
    straight back. The thin face with a pale complexion gave him a gaunt look.
    His large black eyes would bulge whenever anything exciting or unusual
    happened, making him look like a startled deer caught in a car's headlights.
    The hygiene problem he had back in the States seemed to be corrected. Either
    that or the rest of us were now putting considerably less emphasis on
    cleanliness and his condition did not seem all that unusual. Dillon had a
    high-pitched voice that did not command authority, but the rest of us had
    been threatened and indoctrinated with the power of rank to the point we
    would have taken orders from anyone who wore one more stripe than we did.
    Dillon made a point of raising his voice when officers were around to
    indicate he was in charge. During those times, we would move around faster
    than normal and do our best to act as though we were afraid of him. In
    private, he seldom had to enforce his rank, and we considered him one of the
    crew. All of us, including him, pitched in and did any kind of duty we had
    to do. We could have done a lot worse than Dillon, especially compared to
    men in some of the other gun sections who were living under the same kind of
    strict rules of authority we had back in the States.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Ours was a very democratic gun section, and
    because of that, there was almost no trouble among us. Most everyone was
    conscientious, with one exception, and we went about our duties with
    dispatch. The long training period we had back in the States was paying off.
    I felt that we were a very good gun crew which needed little discipline. The
    relaxed atmosphere made the day-to-day grind much easier to tolerable. We
    took pride in the efficient manner we went about our duties, especially,
    those related to our artillery.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" hspace="6" alt="Jim Crow" vspace="8" src="images/Crow_15_80.jpg" width="240" align="right" height="314">Once we had arrived at a gun emplacement and
    dug in, two men would take off with a reel of telephone wire. They would
    each hold the end of six foot-long steel crowbar that ran through the hub of
    a reel of wire. They would link up a phone at the 40mm gun with another at
    the M-51 mount. The two men would then move out to find the nearest battery
    gun position, usually about five-hundred to a thousand feet away. When they
    came to a road, they either had to go over or under it. Usually they would
    find two trees on opposite sides of the road, climb them, and string the
    wire across. Other times, they would find a culvert under the road and
    thread the wire through it. They became quite proficient at cutting and
    splicing the wire to make adjustments getting the wire through difficult
    terrain. On their route, they might find a dozen other wires (some obviously
    abandoned) from other outfits at the same location.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later in the war, they would splice the
    abandoned wire they found to their own and wind it on the reel to replace
    wire which had been lost or abandoned. The same two men, Crow (See Fig. 80 )
    and Hughes (See Fig. 81 ), always did that job. They enjoyed the challenge
    and liked the freedom it gave them to <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Hughes" vspace="5" src="images/Hughes_15_81.jpg" width="226" align="right" height="311"> roam around and see what was going on.
    The rest of the crew referred to the two of them as our scouts. In this
    case, however, our scouts were not seeking the enemy but rather looking for
    places of interest for us to explore later. They always came back with
    stories about some harrowing or funny experience, some real and some
    imagined. Once they lost a reel of wire in a river and came back soaking wet
    from trying to retrieve it. At first they told us they had to swim a river
    to get to the next gun emplacement, but they were laughing so hard they had
    to tell us the truth. Another time they claimed to have gotten shot at when
    they surprised some trigger-happy GIs. When we got into Germany, the stories
    usually included episodes where they were invited into the home of a couple
    of beautiful blonde frauleins.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">At
    this site, Jim Crow brought back a chicken he had picked up from a
    farmer’s field while he and Hughes were laying wire. (See Fig. 81a)<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>He gave it to the battery cooks who cleaned,&nbsp; cooked it, and
    returned some to Crow. There was not enough to go around for all the
    crewmembers and I did not get any.</span></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="images/Crow_and_chicken_15_81a.jpg" width="464" height="666"></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As soon as all the wires were in place, we
    could phone the seven other gun sections and the battery command post (CP)
    where our headquarters unit was located. The phones came in a heavy tan
    colored leather case, twelve inches-by-eighteen inches-by four inches, which
    had a small crank on the outside you turned to ring on to the party line.
    The five battery headquarters in our battalion communicated with each other
    by radio.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">During the day most of the calls came from
    the CP or from gun sections that had observed something unusual. From
    sundown to sunup, we had to call in every hour on the hour in order of gun
    section. My crew would say "Gun number one reporting," then our
    M-51 crew would say from their telephone, "Machine gun number one
    reporting," then gun number two, etc. That was the way it was supposed
    to work. Telephone lines would be cut, and around 0400 or 0500 hours in the
    morning, things would not go so well. One of the problems was the turret for
    the M-51 mount had a bucket seat that was all too comfortable. Also, the
    large steel plates on which the machine guns were mounted on both sides of
    the gunner greatly reduced one's peripheral vision. It was like being in a
    cocoon, meaning very difficult to stay alert. When our machine gun crew did
    not report in sequence, we would yell at them to get their attention. We
    usually wound up throwing a few stones at the mount in an effort to wake the
    gunner up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of the men in the gun crews liked to
    tease the clerk at headquarters who was keeping score. They would
    deliberately report out of sequence, report two at a time, and mumble their
    responses in an effort to mix him up. The job of taking roll call for eight
    40mm guns and eight M-51 mounts that should have taken ten minutes would
    last half an hour or more. The horseplay was all quite childish, but we had
    to do something to break up the boredom of sitting or standing around in the
    middle of the night doing nothing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After an especially bad night, one of the
    clerks in headquarters reported in frustration to his sergeant, "So bad
    I don't need a job." For a long time after that, whenever our
    crewmembers got an unusually unpleasant work detail-a fairly common
    occurrence-we would look at each other and say, "So bad I don't need a
    job." That fractured statement, as bad as it was grammatically, somehow
    condensed in a few words exactly how we felt about many of the things we
    were doing in the Army.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While in Woippy, we slept on our army cots
    set up on the concrete floor of the barrel factory's office. We laid our
    sleeping bags on top of our two blankets that served as mattresses. The
    building wasn't heated but the weather was mild. We would take off our gun
    belt, helmet, gas mask, jacket and boots and sleep in our clothes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was about 2200 hours on the second night
    before any of the crew thought anything about catching some sack time while
    we were at this location. Some of us who were not on gun duty were just
    getting into our sleeping bags for the first time when we heard something or
    someone making noise in the warehouse. We took a fast count and decided it
    was not one of our crewmembers. All of us who were off duty grabbed our
    rifles. Le Claire and I went outside and raced around the building to cut
    the intruder off. There was enough moon to see our way clearly. Three other
    men took flashlights and went into the factory while a fourth went out to
    notify the crew on gun duty. There was a large door at the opposite end of
    the warehouse from where we had our bunks, so Le Claire and I ran toward it.
    We were about ten feet away when we heard a shot from inside, and the door
    splintered right in front of us as the bullet passed through. If it had
    happened a few seconds later, either Le Claire or I would have been hit. We
    yelled to those inside, and they opened the door. A member of our crew named
    Stevens had fired the shot. We all took turns yelling at him for the dumb
    thing he had done. Then, we all went back to bed and decided an animal of
    some kind probably made the noise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Stevens was the one misfit in our gun crew,
    although he would have been a misfit anywhere he landed. Back in the States,
    during our training, I had stumbled upon him in a wooded area when we were
    camped for a bivouac operation. He was tapping a cigarette into a white
    powder. Dillon had also observed him doing something similar to a cigarette.
    It did not take much imagination to conclude he was taking some kind of
    drug. I had compared notes with Dillon, but we had never told anyone else
    about it. It explained why he acted so spaced-out. The problem was, why was
    he always that way? He seemed to have a difficult time doing the simplest
    things. He was continually being yelled at by some noncom or officer for
    acting or reacting improperly. We referred to him often as Sad Sack, a name
    taken from a cartoon character that appeared in Army publications. The name
    fit Stevens well because the cartoon character could do nothing right, often
    through his own bumbling but occasionally from just bad luck.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Before going into the service, Stevens had
    lived in Los Angeles. Soon after I met him at Camp Haan and before I really
    knew him well, he had invited me to spend a weekend pass with him at his
    mother's house near Hollywood. He spelled out all of the interesting places
    we would visit, and all the fun we would have. It sounded great to me, and I
    thought it would be a great way to be introduced to the entertainment spots
    in the Hollywood area. Soon after leaving camp, I found out this was going
    to be an unusual weekend pass when Stevens insisted we stop and buy a couple
    of bottles of whiskey before we arrived at his mother's house. As it turned
    out, we spent most of the time that weekend sitting at her kitchen table in
    her dilapidated house, playing cards and drinking straight whiskey from
    jelly glasses. The house, inside and out, was a mess. They were real
    hillbillies even though the family had been living in a large metropolitan
    area for many years. The highlight of the conversation that weekend had to
    do with the glorious new mattress the mother had bought the week before. It
    was obviously the biggest thing that had happened to the family in some
    time. Because I did not like hard liquor, my participation in the whiskey
    drinking was faking an occasional sip. Stevens and his family could not
    understand my hesitation in participating in the fun, especially because
    Calvert was what they considered a good brand of whiskey. Anywhere else it
    was considered a bar whiskey. That weekend would be the last time we went on
    pass together.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite all of his shortcomings, Stevens was
    always cheerful and he could be good company. He was racked with
    insecurities and wanted to be accepted more than anything else. He never
    argued or disagreed with any of the crewmembers. We teased him a lot, and he
    took it all with a smile, a smile that was contagious. He had an easygoing
    personality and we all liked him. Most of the time his bumbling was so
    comical it made us laugh, but at other times it was frustrating. However, if
    we had been a real line outfit where his participation would have been more
    critical, I am not sure we would have felt the same. Soon after the shooting
    incident, Dillon and I discussed his questionable competence while he was
    alone on guard duty, but, again, we never took any action. He continued to
    pull that duty along with the rest of us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Before we fell asleep on that second night in
    Woippy, Thomas came in from the gun pit.. He and<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Ferris" vspace="5" src="images/Ferris_15_82.jpg" width="260" align="right" height="341"> the others had just been
    informed over the phone that two soldiers in our battery had died. They had
    found some alcohol somewhere near their gun position and used it to spike
    their drinks. They had assumed it was grain alcohol as used in spirits but
    it turned out to be wood alcohol, which is highly poisonous. One of the two
    was a fellow named Ferris (See Fig. 82) who had been in our gun section at
    one time in the States. We remembered he had a wife and we wondered how the
    Army would describe his death to her. Would they tell her he died in the
    line of duty? If not that, at least they could give the generic reason; he
    died in the service of his country. Just a few kind words, even if they were
    a lie, would make a big difference to his family and friends. We all liked
    Ferris, and we felt bad about what had happened to him and the other
    soldier.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The next few days were quite uneventful. We
    had little to do. It was increasingly difficult to stay alert, sitting and
    standing at our gun positions, watching for enemy planes. While we had
    enough men to man the equipment, it was difficult to always have the best
    man at a given assignment. We partially solved this problem by having those
    who were off duty and not sleeping spend most of their time hanging around
    the gun pit in case they were needed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Zippo Lighter" vspace="5" src="images/Zippo_Lighter_15_83.jpg" width="171" align="left" height="302">During the night, the men who smoked would
    sit on the floor of the gun-pit and cup their hands around the lit end of
    their cigarette. We made the first smoker, on a specific shift go back into
    the warehouse to light up so the two-inch flame from their Zippo lighter
    (See Fig. 83) could not be seen. It was like a small torch that could be
    seen from a great distance. We had been warned that there could be snipers
    about and, even though we did not think there was much chance of one being
    in this area, we were not going to take any chances. After that, each
    successive smoker would light his cigarette by pressing it against the lit
    end of the first man's cigarette as both of them cupped the lighted ends.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One afternoon we noticed a civilian burning
    papers in an open field about one-hundred yards from us. He had a German
    Shepherd dog with him. It was one of the few dogs we would see in Europe.
    Dillon and I started over to see what he was doing. We put a round of
    ammunition in the firing chambers of our rifles and carried them out in
    front of us instead of slung up and over our shoulders like we normally did.
    The dog was not on a leash, and we weren't going to let it intimidate us. As
    we approached the man, he started walking back toward a house with the dog
    following. We picked up a couple of pieces of paper that had not burned yet,
    and they had swastikas on them. We concluded the man was either a Nazi or a
    Nazi sympathizer who was burning the papers to keep from being caught with
    them in his possession.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">About that time, a Jeep pulled up with three
    GIs in it. There was another civilian near the Jeep, pointing to the man who
    had burned the papers. He said something to the men in the Jeep. A
    lieutenant and a staff sergeant got out of the Jeep and without saying a
    word, pulled out .45 caliber pistols. The lieutenant shot the dog and the
    sergeant pointed his gun at the man. They loaded the man back in the Jeep,
    and took off. We were left with a lot of questions and no answers. It would
    not be the last time that this lack of information would plague us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Rations Become Our Main Staple</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our food the first three days in Woippy
    consisted entirely of C-rations, and we were getting very sick of them. We
    made Stevens the cook. We figured it would be hard for him to screw up that
    detail, and it would give him less time on gun duty where he could cause
    real trouble. So far, cooking at this location consisted of filling an empty
    ammunition can about half full of water. The can was about two feet square
    and three feet high. He then built a fire to heat the water we would use to
    warm the contents of the cans.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">He even goofed that up. Grimes and I decided
    to chop some wood for him to use in making fires while we were at this site.
    The warehouse was full of wooden staves used to manufacture barrels, so
    there was a ready supply available. We carried armfuls out into the yard
    and, using long-handled axes, chopped each piece in two. We then took the
    pieces and threw them through a window into the warehouse where Stevens was
    building the fire. After we had chopped enough wood to last a week, we went
    inside to see how Stevens was doing. He had a fire going that stretched for
    twenty feet across a concrete wall and was in the process of burning
    everything we had given him. He now had two cans of water heating; one for
    warming the ration cans and the other for bathing, but he could have heated
    a dozen more with the fire he had going. Again, we yelled at him and were
    reminded you had to explain everything to him in detail. Stevens bumbled his
    way through the entire war.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Meals were provided a number of different
    ways while the war was in progress. When we were traveling in convoy and
    often while in gun positions, we were given packaged food that was known as
    rations. There were four types, but K and C were the ones we had the most.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The K-rations meal came in a small OD-colored
    cardboard box covered with a heavy coating of wax, and the same shape only
    about twice the size of a box of Crackerjack (See Fig. 84). The package was
    designed to be sturdy and lightweight. Each man received three boxes for a
    day's<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="K-Rations" vspace="5" src="images/K_rations_15_84.jpg" width="271" align="right" height="386">
    ration, marked breakfast, dinner, and supper. They were designed to
    supply the required daily nourishment, but most of us were still hungry
    after eating them. The three meals varied somewhat, but there were common
    items in each. Each contained a small can (slightly smaller than a can of
    tuna), a fig bar (called a fruit bar but they all tasted like figs to us, so
    that's what we called them), or a chocolate bar, crackers (also misnamed as
    biscuits), four cigarettes in a little cardboard box, a small packet of
    toilet paper, a paper packet of dried lemon powder or dried coffee with
    sugar to make a drink, one stick of chewing gum, water purification tablets
    or salt tablets, and a wooden spoon. The can usually contained scrambled
    eggs and ham bits for breakfast, processed American cheese or American
    cheese and bacon for dinner, and some kind of chopped meat, like pork or
    beef mixed with something else, for supper. We called the chopped meat
    course Spam, but in reality it was not. Spam was another product. Rarely was
    there any variance from this menu, but, very late in the war, there were
    some changes in the canned products. Sometimes, we wound up with more of one
    kind than another. The fig bar came in handy as a laxative when there were
    too many rations with cheese as the main staple. Because there was such a
    limited variety, even if we got the three different kinds in one day, we got
    tired of K-rations in a hurry. They tasted the best when certain conditions
    were met. First, we were very, very hungry; second, we had hot water to heat
    the can before opening it, and third, there was also hot water available to
    make coffee for those who liked it. Most of us young fellows did not like
    coffee and gave the packets to those who did. I would often exchange my
    cigarette packets for a chocolate bar and there were other exchanges made.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Probably the best description of a K-ration
    came from Armbruster, who said, "They only taste good when you're too
    hungry to care."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">C-rations consisted of two cans, about
    two-thirds the size of a Campbell's Soup can for each meal for a total of
    six cans per day (See Fig. 85). It was a larger amount of food than the
    K-rations, but still only marginally filling. The C-cans also were OD in
    color. For each meal, one of the two cans contained either scrambled eggs
    with potatoes, vegetables with stew, spaghetti, vegetables with hash, or
    pork and beans. Late in the war, they came out with some different<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="C-Rations" vspace="5" src="images/C-rations_15_85.jpg" width="223" align="left" height="340"> varieties
    such as mixtures of ham and lima beans or potatoes, eggs, and ham. We always
    ate these rations out of the can with our mess kit spoon. The other can
    contained a fig bar or a chocolate bar, crackers, four cigarettes, toilet
    paper, and a paper packet of dried coffee or lemon powder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We ate a lot of K and C rations, mostly C,
    that were designed to be eaten hot or cold. As a general rule, we had
    K-rations while traveling in convoys and C-rations when at a gun
    emplacement, but there were some variances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">D-rations were about the size of a small Mars
    candy bar and weighed four ounces. Fortunately, we were exposed to them only
    on a limited basis. It was nothing more than an enriched chocolate bar that
    held up in hot weather. It was used only when absolutely necessary because
    it created intense grumbling among the troops. It was suppose to be high in
    calories and packed with vitamins. There was just one per meal, and, even
    though it tasted good going down, it left you very hungry after eating it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">10-in-1 rations came in a cardboard box
    approximately one foot by two feet by three feet. One box was designed to
    include food to feed ten men for one day, and there were five different
    menus. Because of its size, the ration was not carried by troops in their
    field packs. It was carried by trucks and used primarily in battery field
    kitchens. It was mostly cans of meat and vegetables but it had some goodies,
    as we called them, such as date nut cake in cans, fruit cocktail, candy, and
    cigarettes. As a gun section, we were never issued these rations directly.
    We picked up a lot of them at one of our gun positions in Germany when a
    searchlight outfit left them behind. To us, the goodies were a nice
    supplement to our rations. Although we carried the full boxes of ration with
    us for some time, we finally realized we did not have the proper kitchen
    utensils to properly prepare the meat and vegetable items.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we were not on K, C or D rations, the
    battery cooks would prepare food on field stoves when they could, but this
    did not happen often. We were always moving around and did not stay in one
    site long enough for them to set up their portable kitchen. An even bigger
    problem for them was trying to locate the Ordinance Department and get the
    supplies they needed from them. They often used 10-in-1 rations to prepare
    or supplement meals when outside sources were not available. When things did
    work out, our battery cooks would deliver the finished product to the gun
    crews and serve us from the back of a truck. The hot food was kept in
    ten-gallon insulated buckets and was usually lukewarm when we got it. Where
    you were in the chain of eight gun sections determined the quantity and
    degree of heat of the food you received (See Fig. 85b).<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Mess Kit - World War II" src ="images/Mess_Kit_15_85b.jpg" width=525 height=621 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After about four days in Woippy, we were
    promised a hot meal from the cooks in our battery headquarters. Just before
    they arrived, Grimes informed me he had lost his mess kit. He was always
    losing something. He was a nice guy and one of my best friends, but he could
    get on my nerves because of his antics and his cavalier attitude. The
    aluminum mess kit came in two parts, so I loaned him half of mine, along
    with a knife and spoon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The chow truck showed up after dark. It was a
    meal we were all looking forward to because the rations we had been eating
    were not fulfilling. There were heavy clouds, so we could not see very well
    in the near-total blackness. The cooks knelt at the back end of the truck
    bed and scooped the food out of the containers into our mess kits as we
    stood on the ground. They used flashlights to see what they were doing. The
    menu that night was a pork chop, mashed potatoes, gravy, creamed corn,
    bread, butterscotch pudding, and coffee. The half of the mess kit I had left
    after giving Grimes half was a pan that was about twelve inches long by
    eight inches wide with rounded corners. It was about one inch deep, and
    there were no partitions. Everything served by the cooks went in right on
    top of everything else, no matter how I tried to position the kit when being
    served. Caught on the fly might be a better description. I was on duty at
    the gun so after receiving my meal I sat on one of the tracking seats and
    tried to figure out what was in my mess kit sitting on my lap without being
    able to see it. It might have been a mixture of the gravy and the
    butterscotch pudding, but whatever it was, the meal tasted terrible. After
    taking several forks full, I pulled the pork chop out from under everything
    else with my fingers, figuring at least I could enjoy the meat portion. I
    bit into it and wound up with a mouthful of fat with just a little bit of
    meat. It turned out there was a half-inch layer of fat along the edge of the
    chop and the meat I tasted was as tough as shoe leather. I threw the meal
    out and headed over to the barrel factory to find a C-ration. I had some
    unkind words to say to Grimes and told him he had better find his own mess
    kit. He did find it, but it really didn't make much difference because we
    went back on rations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our gun was situated about fifty yards from a
    dirt road that lead into the nearby town. Just beyond the road was a stone
    fence about four feet high. On several evenings, just before dark, we
    observed someone peeking out from behind it, near where it ended. We
    wondered who it was and what his intentions were. It was making us nervous,
    so we decided to do something about it. Someone suggested putting a round of
    40mm into the fence to scare him away. The machine gun crew, who by this
    time was still lamenting the fact they had not fired a single shot in
    combat, wanted to spray the end of the wall with their guns. Finally, we
    decided to send three men over to check it out. They went and came out from
    behind the wall with three very scared boys in their early teens who were
    just being inquisitive. We were sure glad we had not done any firing. We
    gave them a lecture, but their grasp of the English language was about as
    good as ours was of French. I'm sure they did not understand us, but they
    did know we were upset with them. They probably thought we were going to
    punish them because they looked startled when we gave each of them candy
    before they left. As they walked back toward the village, they kept turning
    around and waving at us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Out To Explore A French Village</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When Sunday came, the church bells started to
    ring in Woippy. We figured it probably was a Catholic church, so Bernal, Le
    Claire, and I headed over there to go to mass. We knew it would give us a
    good opportunity to snoop around the town. As we entered the town, we
    realized it was a very quaint French community. We walked down what appeared
    to be the main street with small shops lining both sides. The cobblestone
    street was narrow, and the shopping area was only two blocks long. We were
    not sure if the shops were closed because it was Sunday or if they were no
    longer in business. We looked in several of them, and there did not seem to
    be anything for sale inside. The town's structures had some war damage, but
    not too much. As we approached the church at the far end of the business
    district, we saw the local people were not headed toward it but rather to a
    garage across the street where mass was being held. We looked up at the roof
    of the church and saw a big hole in it. We nodded and smiled at the
    civilians, but they were not a bit friendly. Hadn't our Army liberated these
    people from German occupation? Maybe they'd gotten over being grateful, they
    could at least have been friendly; smiled at us or made eye contact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We began to refer to the French civilians as
    Frogs. Whenever we were down on someone, we always used the derogatory name.
    The British soldiers had become Limeys instead of Brits when we were at Camp
    Stapley, and later, the Germans would be Krauts, Huns or Nazis depending on
    how we felt about them at the time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We moved into the garage with the civilians
    and stood against a sidewall about half way toward the front. Most of the
    people were standing; the few chairs were only for the elderly. The place
    was very crowded, and we were the only soldiers. We tried to look
    inconspicuous, but it was no use. We were balancing a rifle, gas mask,
    bayonet, and steel helmet, and we each had a bandoleer of ammunition. The
    bandoleer was a cloth strip that hung around the neck and it looped down in
    front of the chest where there were ten pockets. Each pockets held a clip of
    eight rounds of rifle ammunition. At the consecration of the mass, we all
    got down on one knee with our arms propped up on the other knee. I was
    holding my steel helmet in one hand and the bulky gas mask kept getting in
    the way of my movements. When the altar boy rang the bells, I dropped my
    head and was staring down at the rifle between my legs. What an
    uncomfortable situation to be in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were a couple nuns with their wing like
    swooping headgear on the other side of the room. I made a point of not
    looking in their direction. I would not have liked to admit it to myself,
    but I was still somewhat in awe of them after being exposed to their strict
    discipline during my eight years of grammar school. If they had come over to
    me in this makeshift church and said, "This will go on your permanent
    record," I would not have been surprised.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">From the dirty looks that we were getting
    from some of the civilians, we figured this town was either pro-German or
    did not like armed soldiers in their makeshift church. With the town being
    in Alsace-Lorraine, the people could have been more German than French,
    which would explain the man who was burning German papers earlier. There was
    also the other possibility the American Army had shelled the town when the
    Germans were there, which could have accounted for the hole in the church
    roof.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After mass we stood out in front of the
    garage waiting for the priest to come out. We figured he might speak English
    and we could talk with him. He came out with the two altar boys each holding
    large candles in one hand while cupping their other in front of the candle
    flame. We gave the priest a big, "Hi, Father!" He took a turn and
    walked right by us without saying a word.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We ran through a half-dozen reasons why he
    shunned us, but we really had no idea what it was. Was he, too, pro-German?
    We thought again about who had caused the bomb damage to his church. Many
    years later, I felt I had the answer, and it was not nearly as mysterious as
    we speculated at the time. When the incident occurred, the priest was
    carrying blessed hosts for Holy Communion back to the church, and by church
    law he was not supposed to talk to anyone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On the way back to the gun pit, we passed an
    old man pulling a cart who was headed into town. By this time, we had
    stopped nodding at civilians, so we were surprised when he gave us a big
    "Bon jour!" and we responded in kind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On March 18, we got the command, "March
    Order," over the phone. This meant we were to load up and get ready to
    move out. We emptied the sand bags, stacked them in piles, and loaded them
    on the two trucks to be used again at the next gun position. The director
    and power plant took six men each to lift onto the truck bed. All the
    remaining equipment was positioned to allow as much room as possible for the
    crew. The telephone wire crew returned after gathering up most of what they
    had strung when we first arrived. We raised the gun to its wheels, pulled it
    out of the pit, covered it with the canvas tarpaulin, snapped the canvas
    into place, and attached the draw bar to the two-and-a-half ton truck. The
    machine gun crew hooked the M-51 mount up to the other truck. As the final
    step, the fifteen men of the crew loaded up. A Jeep came by and led us to
    the site where our battalion was forming into a convoy. We headed north into
    Luxembourg.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All Jeeps in our convoy had been outfitted
    with a steel bar welded to the front bumper and extended vertically to a
    height above the top of the windshield. Near the top of the bar, at the
    front, was a notch that was filed to a sharp edge. The Germans were
    stretching wires across roads as they retreated to decapitate GIs riding in
    open Jeeps. The bar with the hook was a makeshift method of cutting the wire
    before it could harm passengers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On the convoy to Luxembourg, we learned one
    reason we were not supposed to keep a round of ammunition in the firing
    chamber of the 40mm gun. There were some anxious moments-actually, it was
    more like an hour-as we drove along thinking we had forgotten to take the
    round out of the gun's breech before we left Woippy. Was the next bump we
    hit going to set it off? Following directly behind us in the convoy, and in
    line with the barrel of the gun, was the truck carrying our machine gun crew
    and pulling the M-51 mount. If the 40mm did go off, they would be wiped out.
    Nobody could remember removing the round, and it was some time before we
    realized Grimes, who was up in the cab of the truck, may have done so. We
    were quite relieved when the convoy stopped so we could talk to him. He had
    indeed taken the shell out and we all let out a sigh of relief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We also saw parts of the Maginot Line, the French fortification built along
    the French-German border to stop the Germans from invading their country. As
