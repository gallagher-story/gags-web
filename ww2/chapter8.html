    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our outfit continued its training. A few
    months after the cadet incident, we got a change in our noncommissioned
    officers. Monteleone was transferred elsewhere. We didn't ask where because
    we didn't care. Our only concern was he was no longer part of our
    organization. One staff sergeant, who was a cadre member, got a medical
    discharge for some reason and we speculated it was because of his contacting
    a social disease. The stories of his immoral behavior he bragged about
    continuously would lead one to that conclusion. Meanwhile, Sergeant Lush
    wound up in the camp stockade awaiting court martial for going AWOL several
    times.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another corporal who was part of that group was also in the stockade
    for going AWOL. This pretty well wiped out the original cadre team and they
    brought in a whole new team to replace them,. These guys were draftees like
    us who had been in the Army since shortly after Pearl Harbor, and they had
    one to two years more service. The difference was like night and day. We
    seemed to have been lifted out of a pit of sleaze because this new bunch of
    rocker-armed sergeants, anything but exemplary in their conduct,
    nevertheless gave us a sort of cleansing feeling. The change was noticeable
    in many ways, but in particular it greatly reduced the amount of complaining
    we did.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The new men were just as strict with us as
    the others, but every statement out of their mouths did not have some
    off-colored or downright perverted meaning. We considered the change a big
    improvement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The new first sergeant was named Ambrose, and
    he was completely different from Montelone. He was short and husky with a
    barrel chest. He seldom raised his voice, but he seldom had to. We knew by
    his appearance he was not someone to tangle with. The greatest difference
    was in his method of administration. Things like leading the first call in
    the morning and daily formations during the day were left to the platoon
    leaders. We seldom saw him except hanging around the orderly room. This
    authority by delegation kept up for the rest of our military service.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A new officer, Lieutenant Engler, was put in
    charge of our platoon, which consisted of gun sections 1, 2, 3, and 4. He
    seemed a little more open with us and, therefore, was fairly well respected.
    He was younger than the other officers in our unit and, to a limited degree,
    would engage in general conversation with us when conditions warranted, but
    never when Captain Mc Kee was in the vicinity. Like the other officers, he
    followed the strict code of not fraternizing with us during our off duty
    time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our new platoon sergeant was Staff Sergeant
    Lou Kornich (See Fig. 60b). Until his arrival, we <img border="0" hspace="12" alt="Lou Kornich" vspace="12" src="images/Lou_Kornich%20_8_60b.jpg" width="300" align="right" height="372"> had both feared
    and hated anyone in that
    rank and position. It was different with Kornich, who was both feared and
    liked. That is, he was liked as well as you could like someone who spends
    most of the day yelling orders at you and crabbing about how you performed
    duties he assigned. The nickname of crab ass was soon tagged on him. When he
    had some detail to fill he would approach us and say, "I want two
    volunteers." Because nobody ever volunteered for anything at this time
    in our training, he would follow up with a quick arbitrary selection of,
    "You and you." He snapped commands unmercifully as he ran us
    through close-order drills on the parade grounds. We began to feel like we
    were some kind of a crack drill team that had been lying low but was now
    blossoming. His efficiency made it harder for us to dislike him. So, why in
    the hell did we like him? Was it that our expectations had been lowered?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kornich had class, a quality subordinates
    would not normally ascribe to their sergeants. It was hard to define and the
    word itself was never used. It was just something we felt. We felt like we
    were under the command of a real leader who had the ability to guide us
    properly under all circumstances. This made reacting to his constant orders
    somewhat easier to tolerate. Not that we had either an option or an
    alternative. Blind obedience and conformity-the alpha and omega of military
    life-were the law, and any thought of dissent or individuality had been
    eliminated from our psyche by now.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We wondered at first if our approval of
    Sergeant Kornich was real, or if he simply looked good in comparison to what
    we had come to expect. Were we comparing him to the recently-departed
    Sergeant Montelone, the cadre members and the always obnoxious Captain Mc
    Kee; and concluding he was the best of the worst. As time went on, our
    approval of Kornich's style did not diminish. Then too, we had all become
    better soldiers, and we knew better how to do what was required of us. Over
    the next several months, Kornich even seemed to mellow somewhat. The shocker
    came when we found out later he was seen at the chapel every Sunday, and had
    high moral standards. He did not wear his religion on his sleeve but
    everyone soon learned this was a completely different breed than the cadre
    members. The morale of our outfit, especially our platoon, was greatly
    enhanced by his arrival.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">By the time we got Kornich and the other new
    noncoms, we had learned there are no compliments given out in the Army.
    Nobody ever says "You did a good job," or "You really looked
    good on that drill today." Every day we heard nothing but reprimands
    and negative responses to everything we did. It was all part of the
    psychological indoctrination to make freethinking civilians into puppets who
    reacted immediately to any and all commands, regardless of consequences.
    This stupefied state of mind means the leaders were better able to send the
    dolts up against an enemy trying to waste them. And so Sergeant Kornich and
    the rest prepared us to be soldiers who obeyed orders on command-right or
    wrong, sensible or not, difficult or dangerous.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I got to go home on a furlough. The train
    trip took two days each way, and I was home for five days. My brother Jim
    was home on furlough at the same time so I got to compare notes with him.
    While home I bought a new hat I had seen in a shop downtown. I thought it
    looked pretty cool until I wore it for the picture outside the front door of
    our apartment building (See Fig.&nbsp;60c). From the smile on my brother
    Jim's face, obviously he thought it was more on the funny side. I believe I
    wore it only a few times.</font></p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="Jim and Bob Gallagher back in Chicago" src ="images/Bob_and_Jim_8_60c.jpg" width=414 height=723 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Almost all my buddies from the old neighborhood were scattered all over the
    world but there were a few available with whom I could enjoy a few beers.
    They brought me up to date on what had happened in the neighborhood since I
    was gone and any news they had heard from other friends in service.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Back at Camp Haan, we went on several
    extended maneuvers. One time we went up to an air base just outside of the
    town of Santa Maria. We set up our guns around the field and stayed for
    several weeks. Shoulder insignias for the Fourth Air Force were issued and
    we sewed them on our right sleeve. We lived in air force barracks adjacent
    to the airfield. It was a base for the twin-engine P-38 Lightning fighter
    planes, (See Fig. 61a) and pilots were being trained in this plane for the
    first time. It was considered a hot ship, and there were a lot of accidents.
    Two soldiers in our outfit got the Soldier's Medal for pulling a pilot out
    of a burning plane that had crashed as it tried to land.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img border="0" alt="P-38 Lightning" src ="images/P38_Lightning_8_61.jpg" width=600 height=265 ></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One evening while I was walking across an
    open field at the end of the runway to a movie, I looked up to see one of
    the P-38s, with only one engine operating, making the approach to the
    runway. I wasn't sure if the pilot had lost one engine or if he was
    practicing one-engine landings as part of his training. Suddenly, without
    any warning, it dropped down and crashed onto the field about fifty yards in
    front of me. It made this sickening noise on impact as it plowed a long
    furrow in the ground. We watched the panic-stricken face of the pilot
    through the canopy as he skidded to an abrupt stop. When I got to the crash
    site, several GIs had opened the plane's canopy and were talking to the
    pilot. An ambulance arrived in minutes, and when they lifted him out of the
    cockpit, he looked stunned. His body was completely limp but his eyes were
    open and we could not see any bleeding. The next day we heard he died.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, the accident situation got so bad
    that the Army Air Force had the chief test pilot from Lockheed Aircraft
    Company in Burbank, California, the manufacturer of the plane, come down to
    show the new pilots what the plane could do under the guidance of an
    experienced pilot. The pilot's name was Anthony "Tony" Le Vier,1
    and he was considered one of greatest test pilots in the country. He put on
    quite an air show for them, and we got to enjoy it too. He flew with only
    one engine working the entire time he was in sight. As part of his
    demonstration, he flew the plane upside down for the length of the airstrip
    with the canopy about ten feet above the concrete. At the end of the
    airstrip, he rose up slightly, turned the plane up on edge, and flew between
    two closely spaced trees. I don't know if it helped the new pilots or not,
    but it was a great thrill for the rest of us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We loaded up and returned to Camp Haan that
    evening. It was our first night time convoy that did not go too well. Many
    gun sections got mixed in with civilian traffic and we heard some got lost.
    There was a lot of ribbing of those who showed up late.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Time was passing and wondered why we were not
    being sent overseas. There was a persistent rumor going around our battalion
    that made us nervous. It called for our antiaircraft unit to be broken up
    and sent to Europe as replacements for infantry outfits. We all hoped it
    would not come to pass.</font></p>
