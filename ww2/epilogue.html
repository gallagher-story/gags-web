    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After two years and ten months in the army, I
    had learned many things but most of them would have no practical use in
    civilian life. I had seen many places and returned to civilian life with
    mixed feelings. Undoubtedly, it was the most exciting time of my life. It
    was a unique experience that I would not have missed for the world, but I
    certainly would not want to do it over again. I had participated in a truly
    "world war" that was the largest in history. I had served my
    country without hesitation, and for this I had been rewarded. Rewarded in
    knowing that I had done the right thing in always being able to hold my head
    high with the feeling that, when my country needed me, I responded. Being in
    the army would turn out to be the defining episode of my life and greatly
    affected my future. How hard that would have been to anticipate during the
    war years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was only later in life that I felt the
    need to analyze these feelings. Upon discharge in early 1946, I was still a
    young man. My thoughts at the time were primarily about the future,
    although, only the near future. Reminiscences about the war at that time
    were primarily for the purpose of telling one of my returned veteran buddies
    a story about some unusual happening or about some outlandish character I
    had met. Little or no effort was made to ponder the deeper meaning of what
    had happened and the ramifications of it on my future life. Psychological
    and other deeper meanings of things came only when I was much older. Also,
    unlike most other veterans, I had a large number of photographs with
    many of them taken at strategic locations before, during and immediately
    after the war. Fortunately, I had outlined many of my experiences with the
    names, places, and dates with little anecdotes of each immediately after my
    discharge from the service. I was able to add more details to them a few
    years later and to glean even more memories that they generated while
    preparing this book. In doing so, I was able to not only produce a history
    of what had happened but also to understand the effect that the experience
    would have on my later life. Also, after many years of trying, I finally was
    able to find veterans of my 815th Battalion through the VFW (Veterans of
    Foreign Wars) organization. The ten men I found furnished me with some of
    the information found in this story. Some of it was things I had forgotten,
    and other happenings that I had never known about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was easy to summarize my experiences
    during the war but not so easy to analyze them objectively. There were many
    high moments, low moments, disappointments, and exciting times that all come
    together in a mixture of feelings. I enjoyed the friendships I experienced,
    the excitement that gave me lasting memories, and the opportunity to see
    places that I would not have other wise. The things I would rather forget
    are: the death, destruction, upheaval, and misery seen in Europe; waste of
    people and resources caused by warfare; and the boredom, inefficiency, and
    inequalities of the Army.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was one good thing that resulted from
    my military service that outweighs all the unpleasant ones. While it
    happened after I was discharged, it would not have occurred at all if I had
    not spent time in the Army. The years of service greatly matured me and when
    I decided to go to college, I was able to do so under the GI Bill of Rights
    at no cost to me. Before the war, I had neither the inclination nor the
    money to do so. This bill, more than any other act ever passed by the
    government, changed the social structure of the country. It allowed millions
    of ex-GIs like me to go to college, which previously had been the
    opportunity only of the few, mainly the wealthy. It gave the country a whole
    new class of educated people. The degree I earned while in college was of a
    tremendous value in changing my standard of living. It also had the effect
    of changing my future family's thinking about the value of a college
    education and the resulting success it brings. All five of my children
    graduated from college with some of them going on for advanced degrees. To
    them, it was just the natural thing to do. The new mindset had been
    established many years earlier.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One thing I am sure about is the fact that I
    was lucky to have drawn the kind of duty that enabled me to survive the war
    without a scratch. I had seen that men died or were badly wounded on a
    random basis. However, being in certain branches of the army like the
    infantry increased your chances many times. Whether it was luck, fate,
    coincidence, or God's way that determined what had happened to me, I am
    grateful that it worked out the way it did.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Looking back on it, there were four episodes
    in my army experiences that could have produced a more dangerous assignment
    and possibly have resulted in a less positive ending.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">First, despite two tries, I was unable to get
    into the Army Air Force to be a pilot. Undoubtedly, this was my greatest
    disappointment during the war and possibly of my life. But, in failing to do
    so, it may have greatly increased my life span. After seeing John Boswell's
    name on a list of those who were killed, I realized that what had happened
    to him could also have been my fate. Although the fact that he was killed
    does not mean that I would have been too, it did make me ponder the trick of
    fate that kept me from achieving that goal. Flying airplanes, especially
    over enemy territory, would have been a much more dangerous duty than the
    one I had.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Second, and directly relating to the first,
    was the fact that even if I had been accepted as an Air Cadet and especially
    after the second test I took, there is a strong possibility that I still may
    not have finished the pilot program. By the time I was able to apply for the
    second time, the Army Air Force had achieved air superiority in both
    theaters of operation and they were not going to need as many pilots as
    originally thought. At one point, 71,000 aviation cadets were released for
    the ground forces, primarily to line outfits with most of them going to the
    infantry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Third, when I heard that I was eligible for
    the army's ASTP program, I envisioned spending a good part of the war at
    some university earning credits for a degree. When that never happened, it
    was another disappointment. What I learned later was, at the time I would
    have been in the program, more than half of the students were sent into
    rifle companies with resulting heavy casualties. Because they did not have
    the proper training in infantry tactics, they were ill equipped to meet the
    challenges of a rifleman. In February 1944, in anticipation of manpower
    needs, the army cut the ASTP program from 150,000 to 30,000. Again, I would
    more than likely have never finished the program if I had been selected to
    start it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Fourth, it was a small miracle that our
    Battalion was not broken up and assigned to line outfits. Before we were
    sent over to Europe in the later part of 1944, this was the fate of most
    antiaircraft units who were stationed at Camp Haan in California. Later,
    while we were encamped in England, we came close to becoming infantry
    replacements as the Battle of the Bulge raged over in Europe. If it had
    lasted much longer than it did, I am sure that we would have been converted.
    What saved us from these close calls and resulted in my having a less
    hazardous duty for the rest of the war, is anyone's guess. I am grateful for
    what happened or, more accurately, for what did not happen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Each of these four near misses can be
    described as "dodging the bullet." Literally, I feel that I dodged
    four bullets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>There were some specific things that I did
    not like about the Army</b> and I know I am not alone in this. Some were
    important at the time while others were of less importance and today might
    even seem trivial. Some of them are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Losing almost three years of my youth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· The loss of all individuality, privacy,
      and freedom of expression for that period of time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Learning to dislike and disrespect
      authority (Captain McKee, Sergeant Monteleone, and those-foul mouthed
      "cadre members" did not help here),</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· The boredom, frustration, inequities,
      and lack of information I experienced,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· The Mojave Desert,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· The accommodations and the trip over to
      Europe on the Neuw Amsterdam,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Camp Stapley, England as a whole (or, as
      a hole), and</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· K &amp; C rations.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In compiling this story, <b> many questions were
    either revived or generated anew that will probably never be answered.</b> They
    are interesting to ponder.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Who was the person, or persons, who
      enumerated the number of hits at the 40mm gunnery practice on the Mojave
      Desert? He was probably the one who kept our outfit from being converted
      into an infantry Battalion. I never got a chance to thank him and I
      apologize for calling him a liar. A major exaggerator or one who
      extrapolates beyond normal bounds would be more deserving and certainly
      more kind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· What would my years of service have been
      like if I had been twenty years older than I was, like some of the men in
      our outfit?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Does the Mojave Desert have one
      redeeming feature other than being a place where you can shoot off a gun
      without hitting someone?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· What was the purpose in isolating our
      gun section out in the middle of a valley in the Mojave Desert?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Were Sergeant Monteleone and his fellow
      cadre members psychopaths or just plain depraved?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Were there really enough lifeboats for
      the 8,600 troops, plus the crew, on the Neuw Amsterdam during the December
      1944 crossing?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Who picked those sites in Europe for gun
      emplacements that seemed to have no strategic value?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· If the war had lasted another ten years,
      would some of the members of my Battalion have ever learned the difference
      between the American Mustang and the German Messerschmitt?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· What ever happened to Steve, the Polish
      ex-POW? Did he make it through the Russian occupied territory and, if he
      did, what did he find when he got home?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· What did Grimes have in mind when he
      said, "Someone ought to shoot Lieutenant Kraft?" If
      "someone": had, what would I have done about it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Is war worth all the death, suffering
      and destruction, not to mention the cost?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Do most people really appreciate the
      price that some men paid? Do they care?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">· Did any of the things I learned in the
      Army have a significant bearing on my future as a civilian? Things like:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">How to swear profusely.<br>
        How to field strip, assemble, and fire all kinds of guns.<br>
        How to make a pup tent your home.<br>
        How to put on a gas mask.<br>
        How to dispose of a cigarette butt without it showing.<br>
        How to stay awake at night while on guard duty.<br>
        How to salute someone who you would rather shake your fist at.<br>
        How to stand in a straight line with hundreds of other men.<br>
        How to use a hand-dug latrine in the woods.<br>
        How to see so much death and destruction that you become immune to it.<br>
        How to use a bayonet.<br>
        How to clean out a grease trap.<br>
        How to walk twenty-five miles in combat boots.<br>
        How to climb down off of a debarkation tower in a full field pack.<br>
        How to crawl on your stomach, under barbed wire, while a machine gun is
        being fired over it.<br>
        How to break up a brawl without getting hurt yourself.<br>
        How to wash and shave with cold water out of a steel helmet.<br>
        How to dig a perfect gun pit.<br>
        How to eat K- and C-rations and only complain sometimes.<br>
        How to get so comfortable living out of the back of a truck that you
