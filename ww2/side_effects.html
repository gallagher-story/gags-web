    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">_______________________</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many members of organizations and
    governmental bodies; in addition to individuals, read the story of my
    experiences in World War II and asked to use some of the copy or the
    pictures. Still other requests resulted in more complex experiences for me.
    They have resulted in a trip to Germany, the use of my pictures in a movie,
    the inclusion of one of the chapters in a French magazine and a request for
    pictures by the Pentagon. More information about these happenings is
    described below.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>TRIP TO GERMANY:</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the year 2003, the ex-burgemeister of
    Landau on the Isar, Germany, Nick Söltl, read my story and invited me to
    come to his village in Bavaria and join him and others in their yearly
    pilgrimage where they pray for the peace of the world. It is a combination
    religious ceremony and a testimonial to their war veterans. I agreed to
    attend and decided to take my son, Kevin, with me along with his son, Jack.
    Kevin speaks German that made it a lot easier to communicate with the people
    there. I raised a few eyebrows at home when I announced to my veteran
    friends that I was going to an army reunion - a German army reunion. Landau
    on the Isar was the location of our last gun position in 1945 and we were
    there when the war in Europe ended. Following are some of the pictures taken
    there during my 2003 trip and a comparison of the current scene with that in
    1945.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>MOVIE: "REVOLUTIONARY ROAD"</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the year 2007, I was approached by DWNY
    Productions, Inc. who was working on a movie called "Revolutionary
    Road" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, two of the leading
    movie stars of the day. The studio was interested in using pictures from my
    story taken in Paris during my trip to Nice, France in 1945 - see Chapter
    27, Rest and Relaxation. We arranged a financial agreement and although I
    sold them ten pictures they used only one. In it, they transposed my face
    with that of Leonardo DiCaprio.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>FRENCH MAGAZINE</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the year 2009, I was approached by the
    publishers of a French magazine called Militaria about using a photo and
    some of the information found in my story about my experience in Paris in
    1945 - see Chapter 27, Rest and Relaxation. The magazine specializes in
    military subjects - as the title states - and it is a very high-class
    publication. The main subject of the issue where my information occurs is
    about German uniforms, primarily officers' hats. One of the other feature
    articles there is about the American soldiers in Paris during 1944-5 where
    my information is included.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>THE PENTAGON</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While I get many requests from governmental
    organizations who want to use some of the copy or pictures from my story,
    the one from the Pentagon was a real surprise. Following is a copy of the
    request.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sir,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">May the Army have permission to use this
      photo titled "Camp Irwin on the Mojave Desert" at the Pentagon
      for a timeline and display of photos from 1775 through today? What year is
      this from? Is this a US "Army" photo with US Army Soldiers? This
      is a project by the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for
      Installation Management. (http://www.acsim.army.mil/). The timeline
      focuses on "housing" for the Army through the years, and that's
      why we like this tent photo. Or, maybe you have others for us to choose
      from? I can include at the end of the outline something you wish us to
      include, such as your name, email, web site, or something of the sort. I
      see a few more that might be good for our display. May I use any of them
      if we credit you Sir?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you, Shannon Reilly&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Your photo And may we also have permission
      to use this one from this link (see attached photo). Name of photo is
      titled "Rows of pyramid tents - camp Irwin on the Mojave
