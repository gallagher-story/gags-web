    <p align="left"><i><b><font face="Arial">The harder the conflict, the more 
    glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is 
    dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile 
    in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by 
    reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart 
    is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his 
    principles unto death.<br>

</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We arrived on May 4th. This location was right in the 
    middle of a farm field in the town of Landau. It had been raining again, so 
    everything was a sea of mud. We decided not to set up our tents, because it 
    was a lot of work; with the wet ground, everything would be a mess. This 
    meant we would have to sleep in the truck again. The trouble was, there 
    wasn’t much room in there with all of the junk we had accumulated. On our 
    trip from Regensburg, we had come to a viaduct but we were unable to clear 
    it because of things sticking up above the top of the truck.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" alt="Landau, Germany  -  Steinfels Mill" src ="images/Landau_Steinfels_Mill_23_146.jpg" width=550 height=390 ></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had to stop 
    and rearrange everything and we got a lot of static from the brass for 
    holding up the convoy. At Landau, we threw away a lot of items (mattresses, 
    chairs, a stove, etc.) to make room for all of us to sleep in the truck. 
    There was a sawmill (known to the locals as Steinfels Mill) nearby (See Fig. 
    146) we hung around in if we did not have daytime duty. It was also our 
    kitchen. We used an old ammunition can to boil water over an open fire to 
    heat our cans of rations and make coffee, just like we had done in Hanau.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Early on May 6th, we started to get word over the phone 
  that the war in Europe was nearing its end. We could hardly believe it. Up 
  until then, we had no idea how close the end was. It had been announced to the 
  rest of the world that Hitler had committed suicide in his bunker under the 
  Reich Chancellery in Berlin on April 30th and the city had fallen to the 
  Russians on May 2nd, but we had heard none of this. Our news bulletins were 
  non-existent and if the European war had lasted another six months it would 
  not have surprised us.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>War Ends in the European Theater</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, on May 7th, we heard the Germans had 
  surrendered. That is, most of them had surrendered. Those that hadn’t were 
  near us in Bavaria, Germany, and in Czechoslovakia. We were only about forty 
  miles from the border between the two countries. We were told to stay alert 
  and to keep our guns loaded, even if we heard the war in Europe was over.
  </font></p>
    <blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The war in the ETO was officially over on May 7, 1945, 
  at 2:41 a.m., although Victory in Europe (VE) Day was declared the next day at 
  11:00 p.m. Central European Time.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Just a day before, we were issued a new Army portable 
  radio to be carried in the cab of our truck for use whenever we did not have 
  telephone connections. In addition to broadcasts from our battery 
  headquarters, we found we could pick up the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). 
  That station was giving us up-to-date information on the Germans’ surrender. 
  We heard Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, was going to make a 
  speech, announcing the official end of the European war, to be broadcast over 
  the radio at 1300 hours on Tuesday, May 8th. We looked forward to it with 
  great expectations because of its content and because Churchill was such a 
  dynamic orator.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At about 1100 hours on May 8th, I headed into a little 
  forest near our gun position to use the latrine. It consisted of a trench we 
  dug in the ground the width of a shovel, one foot deep, and about four feet 
  long. We called it a straddle trench, and it came complete with a long handled 
  shovel sticking out of the ground to be used to cover deposits and a roll of 
  olive drab colored toilet paper hanging from a tree limb. It was very similar 
  to the bathroom facilities we had used at most of our other gun positions. 
  These woods were very dense, and I had no idea how deep they were. All of a 
  sudden the roar of many planes overhead broke the complete silence. They 
  sounded like they were flying at an extremely low altitude. I looked up 
  through the trees. From what I could see, they all had swastikas or black 
  crosses (German symbols) on them. At about the same time, a 90mm antiaircraft 
  gun battery (See Fig. 147), which sounded like it was right next to me, opened<img border="0" hspace="8" alt="90mm AntiAircraft Gun" vspace="8" src="images/90mm_antiaircraft_gun_23_147.jpg" width="296" align="right" height="360"> 
  up. They were just beyond the forest, which turned out to be quite shallow, 
  about fifty feet away. The percussion sound from the first shot, which I 
  wasn’t expecting, really gave a jolt to my nervous system. My body quivered.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When I collected myself, I went racing back to our gun 
  position. As I cleared the forest, I looked up and saw an amazing sight. There 
  were literally hundreds of German planes overhead. There were FW-180s, 
  ME-109s, JU-87s Stukas (dive bombers), JU-88s, and just about any type of 
  plane that the Luftwaffe had in their air force. There were even some 
  two-winged observation planes. The faster planes had their flaps down to 
  reduce their speed, in order to stay with the slower planes. The armada 
  completely filled the sky, and they were all flying at what I estimated to be 
  3,000 to 4,000 feet. My fellow crewmembers of both the 40mm gun and M-51 
  machine gun mount were blasting away, and there were dozens of other guns in 
  the area doing the same thing. When I first saw the planes after clearing the 
  woods, I thought I had also seen an American plane among the German ones. 
  Looking again, I saw two P-47 Thunderbolts (American fighter planes) (See Fig. 
  148) pulling up their flaps and maneuvering to get out of the area.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" alt="P-47 Thunderbolt" src ="images/P47_Thunderbolt_23_148.jpg" width=500 height=272 ></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were planes dropping all over the place. Our gun 
  stopped firing at about the time I arrived at the pit. Thomas, from our crew, 
  had stayed on the phone, and he finally got word from headquarters about what 
  was happening. He had been yelling, “Stop! Stop! Stop!” since I cleared the 
  woods, but those on the gun could not hear him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It turned out this armada was flying from an airfield in 
  Czechoslovakia to another field in Germany so they could surrender to the 
  Americans. The Russians were overrunning their airfield in Czechoslovakia, 
  where these planes had been stationed, and the Germans did not want to be 
  captured by them. The two American P-47 Thunderbolt fighters were escorting 
  them into the Allied territory, but unfortunately, no one had notified the 
  antiaircraft units in our area. We would learn later that many German soldiers 
  were also fleeing west on foot and occasionally in vehicles to avoid being 
  captured by the Russians.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were still dozens of guns throwing up their 
  tracers, including our M-51 machinegun mount. Dillon had to race over to their 
  site and pull the gunner’s hand off the trigger. He had yelled at the two men 
  who were feeding the ammunition to stop the gunner from shooting, but they did 
  not understand his instructions with all the noise and excitement. Also, while 
  they would probably deny it, both crews were so pumped up and deeply 
  indoctrinated in shooting at enemy planes they could not imagine not doing so 
  for any reason. It was the biggest and best selection of targets we had seen 
  to date, and, in fact, there were more German planes that day than we had seen 
  during our entire stay in the ETO. The rest of our battery guns finally 
  stopped but the 90mm guns were still going at it. They were setting their 
  shells to explode at the lowest level possible, but they were still going off 
  far above the low flying planes, leaving their signatory puffs of white smoke 
  in the sky. One of the 90mm shells made a direct hit, and that plane flew into 
  pieces. The heavy guns did not stop firing until what was left of the armada 
  had cleared the sky above us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">What happened that day was a real blunder. The Army even 
  had a special name for such incidents. It was called a SNAFU, which stood for 
  “Situation Normal, All Fouled Up.” Every man who ever wore a uniform saw 
  hundreds of SNAFUs during his duty.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the planes crashed about two-hundred feet from 
  our pit. Bapst, LeClaire and I headed over to the crash scene to investigate. 
  The open-cockpit two-seater observation biplane had made contact with the 
  ground at about a 45-degree angle. When we reached the plane, we found the 
  aviator in the front seat was smashed up against his instrument panel, very 
  obviously dead. The one in the back, a very young high-ranking officer, had 
  climbed out, or maybe he was thrown out of the plane. He was lying on the 
  ground. Before we could reach him, a couple other GIs stripped him of his 
  flight jacket and boots, and then took off. When we got to the officer, he was 
  unconscious but still breathing. We tried to make him comfortable, but there 
  wasn’t much we could do for him. Other than a small wound on his head, we 
  could not see what was wrong with him. I ran back to our gun position, phoned 
  for an ambulance and then returned to the crash site. One (American) showed up 
  in a very short period of time, but the medics insisted on taking the dead 
  airman out of the plane, which took a lot of time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we stood next to the wounded pilot on the ground, the 
  human factor took over. It was one thing to watch the antiaircraft guns shoot 
  dozens of planes out of the sky just a few minutes before, but watching one 
  person die in front of us was something else. No matter how we tried to look 
  at him as the enemy, he looked an awfully lot like most of the American airmen 
  we had seen. We could see his breathing getting shallower and shallower as 
  time went on and his life ebbed away. I had never seen anyone die up close 
  like that before, and the fact he was the enemy did not make it any less 
  unpleasant. By the time they loaded him into the ambulance and took off for 
  the hospital, his condition was such that the morgue would have been a more 
  appropriate destination.</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Churchill's Thrilling Victory Speech</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">
  It was getting near 0100 hours, so we hurried back to our gun pit and gathered 
  around the truck radio to hear Churchill. The speech was magnificent, and we 
  would learn later it would be known as the Ministry of Health Balcony Speech, 
  given before a very jovial and wildly cheering crowd. The first part went as 
  follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not 
    victory of a party or of any class. It’s a victory of the great British 
    nation as a whole. We were the first, in this ancient island, to draw the 
    sword against tyranny. After a while we were left all alone against the most 
    tremendous military power that has ever been seen. We were all alone for a 
    whole year.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the conclusion of the speech, we heard the crowd 
  break out singing Land of Hope and Glory, known as Pomp and Circumstance March 
  in America. Several of our crewmembers were waving their arms as though they 
  were leading the band. Many of us had marched to that song at our high school 
  graduations just a few years prior, and it created a lot of nostalgic feelings 
  for us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were all elated about the victory. There was no wild 
  cheering at first but we all had a great feeling of relief; it was Victory in 
  Europe Day. We heard lots of small arms firing going off in the distance but 
  no heavy guns in our area were fired. After six long years of fighting, the 
  war in Europe was finally over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We still had wine left over from the Regensburg winery, 
  and Crow filled our mess kit cups from one of the five-gallon cans. The entire 
  crew toasted the big day, and then we moved around and made toasts with 
  individual members. The combination of wine and a great reason to celebrate 
  soon produced joviality not seen before among our crew. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later, when the merriment died down, I thought about the 
  German aviators who had been killed the day the war ended, and I felt sorry 
  for them. Then I realized the Germans had started this war and millions (100 
  million by one count) of people, including innocent women and children, had 
  been killed, not to mention those who were crippled, wounded, or displaced. I 
  thought about the slave labor camps, oppressive occupation of countries, and 
  all the other horrible consequences of war that had resulted because of their 
  actions. However, these facts did not make me feel any better about the 
  senseless waste of life I had just seen. The shooting down of the German 
  planes on that morning when the war, in effect, was over, took some of the 
  edge off our celebration of VE day for me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Up until that time, we had not even heard about the 
  concentration camps where millions of Jews and others had systematically been 
  put to death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we got a copy of Stars and Stripes some days later 
  (See Fig. 149), we learned more details about the surrender. Grand Admiral 
  Karl Doernitz, who was in command of all German forces following Hitler’s 
  suicide, had ordered the surrender following an unsuccessful attempt at 
  negotiations. Colonel General Alfred Jodl signed the surrender papers for the 
  Germans and Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower’s chief of 
  staff, signed for the Allies at General Eisenhower headquarters in Reims, 
  France, on May 7th (See Fig. 150). At the insistence of the Russians, another 
  signing took place in Berlin a few days later.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" alt="Victory - Stars and Stripes Newspaper" src ="images/Victory_Stars_and_Stripes_newspaper_23_149.jpg" width=550 height=487 ></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" alt="General Alred Jodl - German Surrender" src ="images/German_Surrender_23_150.jpg" width=500 height=375 ></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Third Army mopped up the last resistance by the 
  Germans in a couple of days, but we saw no action ourselves. We got the 
  command, March Order by phone, loaded up our trucks, and prepared to join the 
  convoy. Now all we had to worry about was being sent to the Pacific Theater of 
  Operations, where the war with the Japanese was still going strong.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As we were pulling away from this gun position, we 
  noticed some German youths were setting fires in the area (See Fig. 151). They 
  seemed to have no other motive other than making trouble. They had already 
  torched one farmer’s barn and were working on another one. We took a picture 
  of one of the smoldering structures Bapst commented sarcastically as he 
  observed them, “There are mothers’ little darlings doing what they have been 
  taught. They’re showing their neighbors what they learned in the Hitler youth 
  program.”<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" alt="Landau, Germany" src ="images/Landau_burning_building_23_151.jpg" width=550 height=432 ></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Up until that time in the war, our destiny had pretty 
  well been defined as we moved from one town to the next in the ETO. The next 
  decision was going to be an important one that would have strong 
  ramifications. We wondered what was going to happen to us now.</font></p>
