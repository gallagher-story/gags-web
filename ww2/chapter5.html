    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">After I had been at Camp Haan for several
    months, I decided to make my second attempt at applying to be an Air Cadet
    in the Army Air Force. I found out that they were being given over at March
    Air Force Base. Being that close would make it handy but I knew that there
    might be other obstacles. I knew that I would be required to get
    permission from my present unit to take the requirement tests. I had been
    indoctrinated well enough in military protocol by this time to know<img border="0" hspace="10" alt="B-26 Marauder" vspace="5" src="images/B26_Marauder_5_37.jpg" width="350" align="right" height="295">
 that I
    must start at the sergeant level of authority. Considering the caliber of
    high-ranking noncoms we had, I knew that they would not make it easy for me,
    but it was something I had to do.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of the row of huts where I lived
    was the orderly room. From the outside, it looked just like all of the other
    huts except it had a sign on the door identifying its use and a small
    bulletin board out front for posting rosters, such as lists of men who would
    be on KP duty, guard duty, and other assignments for the coming week. Also,
    there might be some kind of a bulletin regarding military news there. But,
    what was inside of the hut made it a place to avoid unless you absolutely
    had to go there. It was the office of the dreaded First Sergeant Monteleone,
    the irrational Captain Mc Kee, and the foul-mouthed cadre members who also
    spent a lot of time there. The battery clerk had some space in there, but,
    if we had something to ask him, we made a point of catching him outside at
    mail call to avoid going inside.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I looked forward to going to the orderly room
    with my request to take the cadet tests with the same trepidation that I had
    experienced when I was sent down to see the principal for a disciplinary
    problem at Our Lady of Peace Grammar School back in Chicago some years
    earlier. Sister Sienna, the principal of the school, believed that she could
    cast out the demons that resided within all young boys, and even a few
    girls, by the use of force. With her flailing wooden ruler she had pounded
    my knuckles on numerous occasions until they hurt badly, and I anticipated
    further meetings with her with great apprehension. I now experienced a
    resurgence of that feeling as I approached the orderly room.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had been told to be sure and knock on the
    screen door and wait to be told to enter. This I did but, despite the fact
    that I could see several men inside the small room through the screen door,
    nothing happened. The knocking procedure had nothing to do with teaching us
    manners. It was just another way they had of showing their supreme authority
    over lowly recruits. Their purpose in setting this requirement was to make
    us feel so insignificant that they didn't even hear you knocking the first
    time. We had to try several times to get their attention. After a second
    knock, I was told to enter into the inner sanctum. I stepped in, closed the
    door and removed my fatigue cap, again, in keeping with prescribed protocol.
    Up until that point, everything was going right but something down deep told
    me that it would not last. Inside, there were three desks one for Monteleone,
    one for the battery clerk, and the third for Captain Mc Kee. Present at the
    time of my visit were Monteleone, the clerk, and one of the cadre members,
    better known as "Sergeant Lush," who was sitting in a corner on a
    chair that was tilted back on its two hind legs. He was reading a comic book
    with his bloodshot eyes only half open. Monteleone did not even look up from
    the paper he was studying. I nodded at the clerk, who immediately lowered
    his eyes so that he would not have to address me. He knew that nobody came
    into the orderly room unless he was desperate. Also, he had been at the job
    long enough to know that, regardless of the reason for the visit, there was
    trouble ahead. He looked more nervous than I did, and he was trying to avoid
    being identified in any way as a friend of mine, even a casual friend. I
    stood facing the cadre member, who gave up his "heavy reading" to
    address me. The conversation went like this:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sergeant Lush: "Wadda ya want?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Me: "I would like permission to go over
    to March Air Force Base to take the exams to become an Air Cadet."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sergeant Lush: "The answer is, no!"
    There ain't no one gonna take no fly-boy test and you ain't gonna transfer
    out of this outfit. Spend your time concentrating on what we're doing here
    instead of trying to get into that Air Force branch." He gave a snicker
    and looked toward Monteleone, who was still buried in his paper. They had a
    habit of glancing at one another frequently when they talked to us recruits.
    Without saying a word, it conveyed the message that said: "Watch me
    make this guy squirm."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Me: "But, I took the tests before
    entering the service and I came close to passing. They (this would turn out
    to be the key word that set off the morons I was visiting) told me that when
    I got into service, I could take the tests again." This brought
    Monteleone out of whatever he was doing and he glared up at me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Monteleone: "Who told you that you could
    take the tests?"</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Me: "Some captain (again, the wrong
    word) who was there in Chicago where I took the tests originally."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Monteleone, raising his voice: "Of all
    the goddamn things, I've heard in my eighteen years in the service, this is
    the first time I've had a f---ing recruit try and get something by using the
    influence of an officer to do it."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Me: "I'm not using the officer, I just
    meant that…."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Monteleone: "Shut up! Who the hell do
    you think you're talking to? You and nobody else is gonna transfer out of
    the 815th. Just because you don't think we're good enough for you don't mean
    you're gonna be no fly-boy."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sergeant Lush: "Yeah, this is a great
    outfit and you should be proud to be part of it" (another glance).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Me: "I didn't say there was anything
    wrong with this outfit, I just want to be a pilot."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Monteleone: "Shut up and get the hell
    out of here before I slap you on permanent latrine duty."</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I wanted to say more but I realized that it
    was no use arguing with either of these guys so I left. Again, I had hit a
    brick wall, and my dream about becoming a pilot was starting to look like it
    was just that: only a dream.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Soon after that episode, Monteleone brought
    up the subject of a "fly-boy" while he had everyone in formation,
    but other than my crewmembers whom I had told about the incident, the rest
    of the men didn't know what he was talking about. I don't remember what else
    he said as he rambled on about being loyal to the great 815th, but it really
    didn't make any difference and I ignored it. I was back to my normal duties.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At times, the army could get very hectic and
    exciting; but there were also extended periods of boredom that would
    generate thoughts of better things. Mainly I concentrated on "what
    might have been" if I had been accepted in the air cadet program.
    Despite failing the tests for a minor item and my turndown for taking them
    again by Monteleone, I still had that strong desire to be a pilot by getting
    into the Army Air Force. I thought about it constantly and was still
    planning on how to get to take the tests again. Being stationed right across
    the road from an air base was not any help. Listening to the planes take off
    and land, seeing the planes overhead on a daily basis, and observing the
    airmen when away from Camp Haan kept the idea, which had now become an
    obsession, fresh in my mind at all times.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I began going over to March Air Force Base,
    across the road, on weekends, just to be near airplanes. It gave me goose
    bumps to watch the planes taxi about and then roar down the runway with
    their mighty engines pouring out full power. Seeing all of the airmen at the
    field with their silver wings and the air cadets whom I was fervently
    wishing to join, inspired new hope in me to continue my quest for a
    transfer. At first, I limited my visits to just standing around in the more
    public areas watching the planes land and take off, but eventually, I
    started to wander around into the hangers. There, I received a few
    inquisitive looks but nobody said anything to me. I made a point of turning
    my shoulder, with the "double A" (for antiaircraft) patch on it,
    away from prying eyes. While standing up close to a plane, one day, a
    sergeant walked up and started to talk to me. He asked me if I wanted to go
    up on a flight and I jumped at the chance. It turned out that he was the
    crew chief of a B-26 twin-engine bomber called the "Marauder" (See
    Fig. 37a) that was going to be&nbsp; towing a target-sleeve behind it for aerial gunnery practice. It would be my
    first flight in an airplane. The crew chief and I sat right behind the pilot
    and co-pilot as we took off. We went out over the Pacific Ocean and soon six
    P-38 Lightning fighter planes showed up. They dove in at the target from all
    angles and fired their guns. They were using tracer bullets to direct their
    fire and to see what they were hitting. I crawled to the back of the plane,
    where the tail gunner would sit to watch the action. It was a spectacular
    sight. I was too big to sit in the gunner's seat, so I watched from a prone
    position.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While flying with the crew of the
    "Marauder," I could not help but notice the friendly relationship
    between the officers and enlisted men. They were able to enforce a chain of
    command but still seemed to have great respect for each other's position. It
    was a refreshing change from the unit that I was attached to and reinforced
    my desire to join them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I went up in that same plane a total of five
    times in the period of one month, but the first flight was the only one that
    had gunnery practice. The others were just checkout flights for the pilots
    and crews. Each time we went up, the sergeant would give me the same
    parachute to wear. On the last trip, he told me that if I ever had to use
    it, I would have to open a flap and bend three wires down so that the chute
    would work properly. The bent wires kept the chute from opening
    accidentally. It's a good thing I never had to use it before that time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">March Field was primarily a base for
    four-engine B-24 Liberator bombers. They would take off and land all through
    the day and frequently at night. We would often observe them flying above
    our camp, lining up in formation. One day, we spotted a column of black
    smoke coming up near the end of the runway and we knew immediately that one
    of the planes had crashed. About half an hour later, we heard a huge
    explosion in our camp, and again the column of smoke appeared. This time,
    one of the planes had plowed right through the front gate of our camp,
    killing a lot of people on the ground in addition to those in the plane. A
    total of six planes went down that day. We found out that, after the first
    crash, the air commander of the base had ordered all planes to go up so that
    the crews would not lose their nerve after seeing the accident right on the
    base. It turned out to be a poor decision because the problem causing the
    crashes was bad gasoline and many of the planes on the base had it. From
    what we heard later, there were a lot of emergency landings in addition to
    the crashes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Each time I returned to Camp Haan after being
    over at March Field, I always felt a great letdown as my duties became very
    routine and even boring. Every day there was more of the same kind of
    training that was now being repeated over and over again. What I was not
    prepared for was the change that was about to take place. Our battalion was
    going to leave Camp Haan for desert training where boredom would be the
    least of my worries.</font></p>
